<h2>THE EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="in2"><span class="sm1">The</span> recent loss of Admiral William Henry Smyth, noticed as it was
by the leading periodicals, will have recalled to many, not only
the social character and amiable qualities of the compiler of this
Work, but also his distinguished professional career and high reputation
as an officer, a navigator, and a seaman, which will be a
guarantee for the details of this posthumous publication.</p>

<div class="bk2"><p>When, in 1858, the Admiral reached the allotted term of three-score
years and ten, yet in perfect health, he executed his resolution
of resigning to younger men the posts he held in the active scientific
world, and concentrated his attention, at his quiet and literary
retreat of St. John's Lodge, near Aylesbury, on reducing for the
press the vast amount of professional as well as general information
which he had amassed during a long, active, and earnest life: the
material for this "Digest" outstanding as the last, largest, and most
important part of it. Had he survived but a few months more, a
preface in his own terse and peculiar style, containing his last ideas,
would have rendered these remarks unnecessary; but he was cut off
on the 8th of September, 1865, leaving this favourite manuscript to
the affectionate care of his family and friends. By them it has been
most carefully revised; and is now presented to the public, especially
to his honoured profession, for the benefit of which he thought and
worked during the long period which elapsed between his leaving
the quarter-deck and his death; as his Charts (constructed from his
numerous surveys), his twenty years' Essays in the <i>United Service
Journal</i>, his efforts to render his astronomical researches accessible
to seamen,&mdash;all testify.</p>

<p>Admiral Smyth was what has been called a <i>commonplacer</i>. He
had the habit of methodically storing up, through a long series of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
years, all that could profit the seaman, whether scientific or practical.
A collector of coins, and in various ways an antiquary, he knew
well, not merely that "many mickles make a muckle," but that it
will sometimes chance that the turning up of one little thing makes
another little thing into a great one. And he culled from the
intelligent friends with whom he associated many points of critical
definition which cannot be found elsewhere. Thus, in addition to
naval terms, he has introduced others relating to fortification; to
ancient and modern arms and armour; to objects of natural history
occurring at sea, in travel, &amp;c.: the whole forming such an assemblage
of interesting and instructive matter as will prove valuable to both
seaman and landsman.</p>

<p>This "Digest" may engage the attention of the naval officer, not
merely for the information it conveys, but for the doubts it may raise
in matters deserving further research. Independently of the variety
of subjects treated, the author's characteristic manner of handling
them will make it to his former brother officers a reminiscence of
one of the true tars of the old school&mdash;the rising generation will find
here old terms (often misunderstood by younger writers) interpreted
by one who was never content with a definition until he had confirmed
it satisfactorily by the aid of the most accomplished of his
cotemporaries; the landsman will discover the meaning or derivation
of words either obsolete or which are not elsewhere to be traced,
though occurring in general literature. To all it is the legacy of an
officer highly appreciated by men of science, who on shore as well as
afloat fought his way to eminence in every department, and always
deemed it his pride that no aim was dearer to him than the advancement
of his noble profession.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="in2"><span class="sm1">What's</span> in a word? is a question which it is held clever to quote and
wise to think unanswerable: and yet there is a very good answer, and it
is&mdash;a meaning, if you know it. But there is another question, and it is,
What's a word in? There is never a poor fellow in this world but must
ask it now and then with a blank face, when aground for want of a
meaning. And the answer is&mdash;a dictionary, if you have it. Unfortunately,
there may be a dictionary, and one may have it, and yet the word
may not be there. It may be an old dictionary, and the word a new
one; or a new dictionary, and the word an old one; a grave dictionary,
and the word a slang one; a slang dictionary, and the word a grave one;
and so on through a double line of battle of antitheses. Such is assuredly
matter for serious cogitation: and voluntarily to encounter those anomalous
perplexities requires no small amount of endurance, for the task is
equally crabbed and onerous, without a ray of hope to the pioneer beyond
that of making himself humbly useful. This brings me to my story.</p>

<div class="bk2"><p>Many years ago, I harboured thoughts of compiling a kind of detailed
nautical <i>vade mecum</i>; but a lot of other irons already in the fire marred
the project. Still the scheme was backing and filling, when the late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Major Shadwell Clerke&mdash;opening the year 1836 in the <i>United Service
Journal</i>&mdash;fired off the following, to me, unexpected announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A Nautical Dictionary, or Cyclop&aelig;dia of Naval Science and Nomenclature,
is still a desideratum. That of Falconer is imperfect and out of
date. We have heard that the design of such a work has been entertained,
and materials for its execution collected, by Captain W. H.
Smyth, whom, we earnestly recommend to prosecute an undertaking of
such promise to the service of which he is so experienced and distinguished
a member&mdash;it could not be in more competent hands."</p>

<p>This broad hint must have been signalled by the gallant Major in the
way of a stimulating fillip, and accordingly it aroused considerable attention.
Among those who were excited by the notification was my friend
Captain Basil Hall, who wrote to me from Paris a few days afterwards&mdash;13th
of January, 1836&mdash;in these words:</p>

<p>"I read a day or two ago, in the <i>United Service Journal</i>, that you had
some thoughts of preparing a Nautical Dictionary for publication; and
from your connection with that journal, or at least your acquaintance
with our friend the editor, I am led to fear that the report may be true.
You will understand the use of the word <i>fear</i> when I tell you that, for
nearly three years, <i>my</i> own thoughts have turned in the same direction,
and I have been busily preparing for a task to which I meant to buckle
to with a will, and to which I meant to devote some four or five years
of exclusive diligence. What I am anxious to know, as soon as may be,
is the fact of your having undertaken a similar work, <i>or not</i>. For I
assure you I am not so foolish, nor so insensible either to my own peace
of mind or my own reputation; nor am I so careless of your good opinion
and regard, as to enter the lists with you. I repeat, neither my feelings
nor my judgment would permit me in any way to cross your hawse, if
indeed, as I too much fear, you have got before me. There is one other
man in the service besides yourself, and only one, with whom no consideration
would induce me to enter into competition&mdash;and that is
Beaufort&mdash;but his hands, I presume, are full enough, and I had somehow
imagined yours were too. So much so, that you were one of the
first men I meant to consult on my return to England, and to beg
assistance from. I should not have minded the competition of any one
else, but I am not so vain as to suppose that I could do the thing as well
as either of you&mdash;and therefore, even if I were not restrained by motives
of personal friendship, I should never dream of risking my reputation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
for professional, scientific, or literary attainments by a struggle in which
I should certainly be worsted."</p>

<p>To this hearty and laudatory interpellation, an immediate reply was
returned, stating that I had long held the subject in view, but that other
weighty avocations occasioned its hanging fire, and had compelled me to
suspend it <i>sine die</i>. Still I considered such a work necessary to the
current wants, as well those of seafarers as of the landsmen who evince
a taste for nautical matters; and that, from his profession and literary
prowess, I knew of no one better fitted for the task than himself&mdash;adding
that, under the emergency, my papers were at his service, and I would
occasionally give him such personal aid as might lie in my power. This
was acknowledged in a long explicatory letter, of which the following
are extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I trust I know the value of a compliment as well as any man, and I
can say, with perfect truth, that in the whole of my career (such as it has
been), professional, scientific, or literary, no compliment&mdash;I may say no
circumstance&mdash;has occurred which has given me so much honest gratification
as your letter of the 3d. I know you are a man not to say
what you do not truly think, nor to express yourself strongly where you
have not observed carefully. I shall therefore not disclaim your compliment,
but rather seek, in a kindred spirit, to work up to the mark which
you assign me&mdash;and which I know but too well how far I am short of.</p>

<p>"I do hope, indeed, that as you say, 'we may row in the same boat
without catching crabs;' but of this I am quite resolved, not to cross your
hawse, nor to interfere with your project, which you have alluded to as
having already commenced. That is to say, I shall not interfere unless
I can be of use to it and to you, and with your full concurrence, and, as
I hope, your companionship. * * * *</p>

<p>"What I should propose would be, that you should furnish the professional
technicalities in all the different branches, and that I should
endeavour to popularize them. Here and there&mdash;as in the matter of
Navigation&mdash;I also might intrude with some few technicalities. But
generally speaking it would be you who should provide the real solid
stuff, and I who should attempt to dress it up so as to be intelligible
<i>beyond</i> the limits of the sea-service; and also to be intelligible to those
young persons whom it is very important to instruct in general and even
popular views, but for whom it would be needless to write a new
elementary treatise. * * * *<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is a sketch of my plan. What think you of it? I must add
one thing, however, that you must be the senior officer on the occasion.
I shall act in all this matter, and in the most perfect good faith, as your
subordinate."</p>

<p>In responding to this full and frank overture, I entered into a few
more particulars respecting my progress and purpose in the projected
work; and invited him&mdash;on his return from France&mdash;to come at once to
Bedford and ransack my papers.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the autumn of 1836, Captain Basil Hall and his
family&mdash;the whole of the Schloss Handfeldt party&mdash;arrived at my house,
where he was located in a quiet library, with all my materials for the
Naval Dictionary before him. Here he remained in close examination
of them during two days, when he promised to send me his ultimatum
in writing after due deliberation. He required time for this, seeing I
had fairly warned him that my onerous undertakings would necessarily
throw the heavier share of our performance upon his shoulders. On the
27th of November I received a letter from Edinburgh, in which he made
this statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With respect to the Marine Dictionary I think we have come to a
clear understanding&mdash;namely, that for the present it is standing fast.
<i>I</i> certainly had a notion that I was an interloper, and as soon as I saw
the vast deal you had done in the way of preparation, that it became me
as a man of fair dealing, to back out. This does not, however, appear
to have been your wish, but on the contrary that we may still make a
joint work of it by-and-by, when we have leisure, both of us, to engage
in it heartily&mdash;tooth and nail. I shall therefore keep it in my thoughts,
and endeavour to shape my future plans so as to meet this view, and,
should I see occasion, I can write to you about it. My present notion
is, that if ever we do set about it, I must come to Bedford for a season,
and give myself entirely up to the work, under your direction. The
work, to be worth a straw, or at all what would be expected from you
and me, would require no small labour on our parts, for a considerable
length of time."</p>

<p>We consequently lay upon our oars for some time, but occasionally
pulling a stroke or two to keep to the station, and be ready for head-way
when required. While thus prepared, in 1842 my excellent and highly
accomplished friend was most unexpectedly assailed by an afflicting
malady, which at once reduced a brilliant mind to a distressing fatuity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which&mdash;after two lingering years&mdash;closed his valuable life, and clued up
our arrangements.</p>

<p>Meantime our plan had oozed out, and too great an expectation was
evoked in certain quarters, the inquiries from whence were frequent
reminders. At length in 1865, most of my undertakings having been
completed, and out of the way, I made an overhaul of the bulky ribs and
trucks of the scheme in question. Both my judgment and feelings
united in showing that it is now too late in the day for me to think of
setting about such a work as was contemplated thirty years ago; yet
finding myself still capable of application, and fully knowing all the
bearings of the case, I feel assured that a comprehensive and useful
"word-book" may be made from the shakings. On the whole, therefore,
the foregoing particulars seem to be a necessary prelude to this introduction.</p>

<p>Doubtless a well-digested marine dictionary would be equally beneficial
to the country and to the service, for the utility of such a work in
assisting those who are engaged in carrying on practical sea duties is so
generally admitted, that it is allowable here to dilate upon its importance,
especially when it is considered how much information a youth has
to acquire, on his first going afloat, in order to qualify him for a position
so totally different from what he had hitherto been familiar with. In
this case such a volume might justly be deemed one of the most useful
of his companions, as it would at all times answer his questions, and aid
that ardour of inquiry which some of his shipmates might not find it
easy to satisfy. It would quicken the slow progress of experience, and
aid those who take a pleasure in the knowledge and discharge of their
duties. But a work of this description must necessarily require constant
additions, and revised explanations, to enable it to keep pace with the
wondrous alterations and innovations which are now taking place in
every department of the naval service. The future of all this is utterly
inscrutable!</p>

<p>Nor has this province been neglected, as the efforts of Captain John
Smith (of mine own clan), Maynwaring, Boteler, Blanckley, Falconer,
Young, and many others, testify; and however they may fall short of
what naval science demands, they are full of initiative training. Indeed
they may all be advantageously consulted, for honey is not the less sweet
because it is gathered from many flowers; and I have freely availed myself
of their various works, as far as they go, though I have adopted no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
term without holding myself responsible for its actuality. Such a vaunt
may be considered to savour of the <i>parturiunt montes</i> apothegm, but the
reader may confidently rest assured that whatever shortcomings he may
detect they are not the result of negligence.</p>

<p>It has been pronounced that such lexicography may be too diffuse; that
to describe the track of every particular rope through its different channels,
however requisite for seamen, would be useless and unintelligible to
a landsman. But surely nothing can be considered useless which tends
directly to information, nor can that be unintelligible which is clearly
defined. Moreover, such a work may be so carried out as not only to be
instructive in professional minuti&aelig;, but also to be a vehicle for making us
acquainted with the rules which guided the seamen of former times,
thereby affording an insight into those which are likely to direct them in
their own.</p>

<p>From the causes already stated, my project of a full sailor's dictionary
fell to the ground; yet in course of time, and at the age of seventy-seven,
finding leisure at last on hand, I thought it feasible to work my materials
into a sort of maritime glossary. The objects of such a digest are to
afford a ready reference to young or old, professional or non-professional,
persons, who by consulting it may obtain an instant answer to a given
question. Now although many of the explanations may be superfluous
to some seamen, still they may lead others to a right understanding of
various brackish expressions and phrases, without having to put crude
queries, many of which those inquired of might be unable to solve.
Nor is it only those afloat who are to be thus considered; all the empire
is more or less connected with its navy and its commerce, and nautical
phraseology is thereby daily becoming more habitual with all classes of
the lieges than of erst. Even our parliamentary orators, with a proper
national bias, talk of swamping a measure, danger ahead, taking the
wind out of an antagonist's sails, drifting into war, steering a bill
through the shoals of opposition or throwing it overboard, following in
the wake of a leader, trimming to the breeze, tiding a question over the
session, opinions above or below the gangway, and the like, so rife of late
in St. Stephen's; even when a member "rats" on seeing that the pumps
cannot keep his party from falling to leeward, he is but imitating the
vermin that quit a sinking-ship.</p>

<p>This predilection for sea idiom is assuredly proper in a maritime people,
especially as many of the phrases are at once graphic, terse, and perspicuous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
How could the whereabouts of an aching tooth be better
pointed out to an operative dentist than Jack's "'Tis the aftermost
grinder aloft, on the starboard quarter." The ship expressions preserve
many British and Anglo-Saxon words, with their quaint old preterites
and telling colloquialisms; and such may require explanation, as well for
the youthful aspirant as for the cocoa-nut-headed prelector in nautic lore.
It is indeed remarkable how largely that foundation of the English
language has been preserved by means of our sailors.</p>

<p>This phraseology has necessarily been added to from time to time,
and consequently bears the stamp of our successive ages of sea-life. In
the "ancient and fishlike" terms that brave Raleigh derived from his
predecessors, many epithets must have resulted from ardent recollections
of home and those at home, for in a ship we find&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="bk2"><p>Most of the real sea-terms are pregnant with meaning; but those who
undertake to expound them ought to be tolerably versed in the topic.
Thus perhaps there was no great harm in Dr. Johnson's being utterly
ignorant of maritime language, but it was temerariously vain in that
sturdy lexicographer to assert that <i>belay</i> is a sea-phrase for splicing a
rope; <i>main sheet</i>, for the largest sail in a ship; and <i>bight</i>, for the circumference
of a coil of rope; and we long had him on the hip respecting the
<i>purser</i>, a personage whom he&mdash;misled by Burser&mdash;at once pronounced to
be the paymaster of a ship; as the then purser was, in fact, more familiar
with slops, tobacco, pork, dips, biscuit, and the like, than with cash payments&mdash;for,
excepting short-allowance dues, he had very little meddling
with money matters. But the Admiralty have recently swamped the
well-known and distinctive nautical title&mdash;despite of its time-honoured
claims to repute&mdash;and introduced the army appellative, <span class="sm2">PAYMASTER</span>, in
its stead.</p>

<p>The pithy conciseness of the brackish tongue renders it eminently
useful on duty. In some of their sea-phrases the French, our great rivals,
use a heap of words more than we are wont to do. An instance is given&mdash;supposing
a ship of the former met with one of ours, and they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
desire to salute each other, the English commander would sing out, "Man
ship!" but the French captain would have to exclaim, "Rangez du monde
sur les vergues pour donner des cris de salut!" By the way, there is a
<i>ben trovato</i> respecting the difficulty of doing our naval tidings into French:
a translator of note made quite a mull of a ship being <i>brought up</i> by her
anchors, and of another which was stranded from <i>borrowing</i> too much;
while "a man-of-war riding easily in the road at Spithead" was rendered
"Un homme de guerre se promenait &agrave; cheval &agrave; son aise sur le chemin
de Spithead." Some of the French terms, however, are recommended by
their Parisian stamp, as in calling iron bilboes "bas de soie"&mdash;the waist-netting
"Saint Aubinet"&mdash;the quarter-gallery a "jardin d'amour:" but
similar elegance was not manifested in dubbing the open-hearted
thorough-bred tar "un loup de mer."</p>

<p>In the work before us, the nautical import of the terms is duly considered,
and the orthography, as far as feasible, is ruled by authority and
custom, with an occasional slight glance at the probable etymology of the
words&mdash;slight, because derivation is a seductive and frequently illusory
pilot. Our language is said to have been arraigned by foreigners for its
hissing enunciation; but, regardless of the rebuke, our pundits have, of
late, unnecessarily increased the whistling by substituting the sibilant <i>s</i>
for the vocal <i>z</i>, in all sorts of cases. Happily this same <i>s</i> not being yet
acclimatized to the galley, Jack will continue to give tongue to an enterpri<i>z</i>ing
crui<i>z</i>e after Portugue<i>z</i>e merchandi<i>z</i>e, and there anent.</p>

<p>The plan of our work may be said to comprise the treating <i>de omnibus
rebus nauticis</i>, for many branches of knowledge are demanded of the
intelligent seaman. Thus in Naval Architecture, the terms used in the
construction of ships, the plans and sections, and the mechanical means of
the builders, are undoubted requirements of a sea word-book. So also
in Astronomy, or that portion of nautical science constituting observations
which are necessary to the determinations of the navigator.
In Mathematics, especially the branch distinguished as practical,
the doctrine which teaches whatever is capable of being numbered or
measured, requires verbal elucidation, not so much for the educated
youth, as for him who labours under difficulties&mdash;who is</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"In canvass'd berth, profoundly deep in thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His busy mind with sines and tangents fraught."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="bk2"><p>Many of the words in our columns are not <i>de facto</i> sea-terms, but as
they are in rife and familiar use on ship-board, they obtained a lodgment;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
whence it becomes rather a difficult matter to mark a boundary for
nautic language. Various expressions are also retained which, though
unused or all but obsolete, occur so frequently in professional
treatises and antiquated journals, that their exposition may often be
welcomed by a general reader: they are here introduced, not as worthy
of revival, yet as necessary to be understood when fallen in with. And
it should be remembered, that&mdash;especially during our last conflict with
France&mdash;so many combined enterprises occurred, that the most general
naval and military phrases pertained, in a manner, to both arms of the
service.</p>

<p>What may be termed mere galley-slang also demands explanation,
since even officers are sometimes ashore&mdash;I was going to say at sea&mdash;respecting
its purport; and I recollect at a court-martial holden on a
seaman for insolence to his superior, the lingo used by the shrewd
culprit was liable to be thought respectful or otherwise according to the
manner of utterance, and he was admitted to the benefit of the doubtful
meaning. Still it must be admitted that all vulgarisms, as far as
practicable, should be indignantly spurned from our noble English
language&mdash;a language unequalled for excellence in fluency, capacity, and
strength. A stern critic may also, and in truth, aver that terms are
included on our roll the which are not altogether of maritime usage.
This we have admitted, but the allegation will be greatly weakened on
scrutiny, for they are here given in the sense entertained of them in
nautic parlance. Such are generally illustrative of some of the lingual
or local peculiarities of sea-life, or borne on its literature, and therefore
are necessarily admitted as having a footing in maritime philology.
Some of our misused words and archaic phrases are, by influence of the
newspaper magnates, brought across the Atlantic, and re-appear among
us under the style and title of Americanisms: after which fashion, in the
lapse of time and the mutation of dialect, vocables once differing in origin
and meaning may become identical in sense and sound.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> As for example the word <i>alarm</i>, <i>alarum</i>, a bell, from the German <i>l&auml;rm</i>; but the
military <i>alarm</i> on a drum is the Italian <i>all'arme</i>.</p></div>

<div class="bk2"><p>Finally, Natural History, a taste for which is a substantial blessing to
the sailor, is too vast a department for our professional pages. However,
a few requisite definitions of the familiar products of the air, earth, and
water are introduced. Numbers of marine birds and many fishes&mdash;so
often misnamed&mdash;are entered upon the muster; and especially those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
which the blue-jackets vote to be very good eating; yet, as a reverend
author has well observed, we should, in such cases, recur to the probable
state of their appetites at the time of experiment. The most general
nautic dishes and refections are likewise cited, to the making of which
most of our sea-cooks are competent&mdash;there being no pur&eacute;e, entremet, or
fricandeau to trouble them. But though they are at times libelled as
being sent from the infernal regions, they are pretty fair in their way;
and though no great shakes in domestic chemistry, they can enter the
lists against any white-aproned <i>artiste</i> at pea-soup, beef-steak, lobscouse,
pillau, curried shark, twice-laid, or savoury sea-pie. Still, a more
luxurious tendency in this department is casting its shadow before; and
there are Sybarites invading the ocean to whom the taste of junk is all
but unknown.</p></div>

<h2>A DIGEST<br />
<span class="fs">OF</span><br />
SEA TERMS AND PHRASES.</h2>

<h2><a name="A1" id="A1"></a>A.</h2>

<p><a name="A" id="A"></a>A. The highest class of the excellence of merchant ships on Lloyd's
books, subdivided into A 1 and A 2, after which they descend by the
vowels: A 1 being the very best of the first class. Formerly a river-built
(Thames) ship took the first rate for 12 years, a Bristol one
for 11, and those of the northern ports 10. Some of the out-port
built ships keep their rating 6 to 8 years, and inferior ones only 4.
But improvements in ship-building, and the large introduction of iron,
are now claiming longer life.</p>

<p>A is an Anglo-Saxonism for <i>in</i> or <i>on</i>; as <i>a</i>'board, <i>a</i>'going, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="AB" id="AB"></a>A.B. The rating of <i>Able Seamen</i> on the ship's books: these two letters
are often used as an epithet for the person so rated. He must be equal
to all the duties required of a seaman in a ship&mdash;not only as regards
the saying to "hand, reef, and steer," but also to strop a block, splice,
knot, turn in rigging, raise a mouse on the main-stay, and be an example
to the <i>ordinary seamen</i> and <i>landsmen</i>.</p>

<p>ABAB. A Turkish sailor who plies in coasting craft.</p>

<p><a name="ABACK" id="ABACK"></a>ABACK. The situation of a ship's sails when the wind bears against
their front surfaces. They are <i>laid aback</i>, when this is purposely
effected to deaden her way by rounding in the weather-braces; and
<i>taken aback</i>, when brought to by an unexpected change of wind, or by
inattention in the helmsman.&mdash;<i>All aback forward</i>, the notice given
from the forecastle, when the head-sails are pressed aback by a sudden
change in the wind. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#WORK_ABACK">Work Aback</a></span>.)&mdash;<i>Taken aback</i>, a colloquialism
for being suddenly surprised or found out.</p>

<p>ABACUS. A board with balls sliding on small rods, used in China,
Russia, &amp;c., for calculating bills, &amp;c.</p>

<p>ABAFT. This word, generally speaking, means behind, inferred relatively,
beginning from the stem and continuing towards the stern, that
is, the hinder part of the ship.&mdash;<i>Abaft the beam</i> implies any direction
between a supposed transverse line amidships and the stern, whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in or out of the ship. It is the relative situation of an object with the
ship, when that object is placed in the arc of the horizon contained
between a line at right angles with the keel and the point of the
compass which is directly opposite the ship's course. An object&mdash;as a
man overboard&mdash;is described by the look-out man at the mast-head as
abeam, before, or abaft the beam, by so many points of the compass.
As a vessel seen may be "three points before the beam," &amp;c.</p>

<p>ABAKA. A fine vegetable fibre, with which the white Manila rope, so
much used on the India station, is made. This rope floats in water,
and is not subject to rot, nor does it require tarring. A frigate on
the China station in 1805 had nearly the whole of her running rigging
of this cordage.</p>

<p>ABANDONMENT <span class="sm1">of a Vessel</span>. Deserting and abandoning her by
reason of unseaworthiness or danger of remaining in her, also when
grounded and cannot be saved. This never occurs but in imminent
cases; therefore, before the insured can demand recompense from the
underwriter, they must cede or <i>abandon</i> to him the right of all
property which may be recovered from shipwreck, capture, or any
other peril stated in the policy. Other parties entering and bringing
the vessel into port obtain salvage. (<i>Vide</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#DERELICT">Derelict</a></span>.)</p>

<p>ABASE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. An old word signifying to lower a flag or sail. <i>Abaisser</i> is
in use in the French marine, and both may be derived from the still
older <i>abeigh</i>. <i>Abase</i> literally means to cast down, to humble.</p>

<p>ABATE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. An old Anglo-Norman word from <i>abattre</i>, to beat down or
destroy; as, to <i>abate</i> a castle or fort, is to beat it down; and a gale is
said to <i>abate</i> when it decreases. The term is still used in law.</p>

<p>ABATEMENT. A plea by which a reduction of freight is demanded,
when unforeseen causes have delayed or hindered the performance of
a stipulated charter-party.</p>

<p>ABATIS. An obstruction used in temporary fortification, composed of
felled trees deprived of their smaller branches, and secured to the
ground side by side with their tops towards the enemy; applicable
to the front of posts, works, or positions, and occasionally to the bars
of rivers.</p>

<p>ABBEY-LUBBER. This is an old term of reproach for idleness, and
is here quoted only as bearing upon the nautical lubber. In the
"<i>Burnynge of Paule's Church</i>, 1563," it is thus explained&mdash;"An Abbey-lubber,
that was idle, well-fed, a long lewd lither loiterer, that might
worke, and would not."</p>

<p>ABBLAST. Cross-bow; hence,</p>

<p>ABBLASTER. Cross-bow man.</p>

<p>ABBROCHYN. The old term for beginning or broaching a barrel,
cask, or any "vesselle of drynke."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="ABEAM" id="ABEAM"></a>ABEAM. In a line at right angles to the vessel's length; opposite the
centre of a ship's side.</p>

<p>ABEAM-ARM. For this curved timber, <i>see</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#FORK-BEAMS">Fork-beams</a></span>.</p>

<p>ABER. An ancient British word for the mouth of a river&mdash;as Aber-brothick,
Aber-avon, Aber-ystwith, and Aber-conway, &amp;c. It also
means the confluence of two or more streams.</p>

<p>ABERRATION. An apparent change of place, or alteration of their
mean position, in the fixed stars, caused by the earth's orbital movement.&mdash;<i>Aberration
of a planet</i> signifies its progressive geocentric
motion, or the space through which it appears to move, as seen from
the earth, during the time which light occupies in passing from the
planet to us.&mdash;<i>Crown of aberration</i> is a spurious circle surrounding the
proper disc of the sun.&mdash;<i>Constant of aberration</i>, or amount of displacement
in the sun's longitude, arising from the progressive motion of
light, is established at 20&#8243;&middot;45.</p>

<p>ABET, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To excite or encourage&mdash;a common word, greatly in use at
boat-racings, and other competitive acts.</p>

<p>ABITED. A provincial term for <i>mildewed</i>.</p>

<p>ABJURATION. The oath taken till lately by all officers on receiving
their commission, by which they abjured any claim of the Stuarts to
the throne, the power of the Pope, and the Romish religion.</p>

<p>ABLE. A term not simply expressive of strong faculties, but as
acquainted with and equal to perform the expected duty.&mdash;<i>Able seaman</i>,
a thorough or regular bred sailor. (<i>See</i> <a href="#AB">A.B.</a>)&mdash;<i>Able-bodied</i>, sound,
healthy, and fit for the Royal service.</p>

<p>ABLE-WHACKETS. A popular sea-game with cards, wherein the
loser is beaten over the palms of the hands with a handkerchief tightly
twisted like a rope. Very popular with horny-fisted salts.</p>

<p>ABOARD. Inside or upon a ship; the act of residing afloat; to hug
the land in approaching the shore.&mdash;<i>To fall aboard of</i>, is for one vessel
to run foul of another.&mdash;<i>To haul the tacks aboard</i>, is to bring their
weather clues down to the chess-tree, or literally, to set the courses.&mdash;<i>To
lay an enemy aboard</i>, to run into or alongside.</p>

<p>ABODE. Waited for; as, ship ran to the appointed place of rendezvous
and <i>abode</i> there for her consort.</p>

<p>ABORD. An Anglo-Saxon term, meaning across, from shore to shore,
of a port or river.</p>

<p><a name="ABOUT" id="ABOUT"></a>ABOUT. Circularly; the situation of a ship after she has gone round,
and trimmed sails on the opposite tack.&mdash;<i>Ready about!</i> and <i>About-ship!</i>
are orders to the ship's company to prepare for tacking by being
at their stations.</p>

<p>ABOVE-BOARD. Over the deck; a term used for open fair dealing,
without artifice or trick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="ABOX" id="ABOX"></a>ABOX. A word used in veering for <i>aback</i>, alluding to the situation of
the head-yards in paying off. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BRACE_ABACK">Brace Aback</a></span>.)&mdash;<i>Lay the head-yards
abox</i>&mdash;in former times, and even at present, many good seamen prefer
to lay the head-yards square, or abox, to heave-to. It brings the
vessel more under command for sudden evolution, wearing, or staying.</p>

<p>ABRAHAM-MEN. A cant term for vagabonds, who formerly begged
about under pretence of having been discharged destitute from ships
and hospitals; whence an idle malingerer wanting to enter the
doctor's list is said to "sham Abraham." From a ward in Bedlam
which was appropriated for the reception of idiots, which was named
Abraham: it is a very old term, and was cited by Burton in the
<i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> so far back as 1621.</p>

<p>ABRASE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To dubb or smooth planks.</p>

<p>ABRASION. The rubbing off or wearing away of the parts of a
rock, or of the soil, by the impinging and friction of other bodies.</p>

opposition to <i>abaft</i> or <i>afore</i>.&mdash;<i>Line abreast</i> means a fleet advancing or
retreating uniformly on a line parallel with the beam.&mdash;<i>Abreast of a
place</i>, is directly off it; a direction at right angles with the keel or
ship's length. In the army the term was formerly used for any
number of men in front; but at present they are determined by files.&mdash;<i>Abreast.</i>
Within-board, signifies on a parallel with the beam.</p>

<p>ABRID. A pintle-plate.</p>

<p>ABROACH. On tap, in use; spoken of barrels of beer or other liquors.</p>

<p>ABROAD. Synonymous with foreign, or being on a foreign station.
Also an old word for <i>spread</i>; as, all sail <i>abroad</i>.</p>

especially such as are bold-to and precipitous.</p>

<p>ABSCISS. A part either of the diameter or the transverse axis of a
conic section, intercepted between the vertex or any other fixed point
and a semi-ordinate.&mdash;<i>Abscission of a planet</i>, its being outstripped by
another, which joins a third one before it.</p>

which a body tends downwards.</p>

<p>ABSORPTION. A term formerly used for the sinking of islands and

<p>ABSQUATULATE. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#SQUATTER">Squatter</a></span>.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT. A brief register of the warrant officer's stores, by which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the supplies, expenses, and remains are duly balanced. An <i>abstract
log</i> contains the most important subjects of a ship's log.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS, <span class="sm1">or Pure</span>. The branch which investigates
and demonstrates the properties of magnitude, figure, or quantity,
absolutely and generally considered, without restriction to any species
in particular; such as arithmetic and geometry.</p>

<p>A-BURTON. The situation of casks when they are stowed in the
hold athwart ship, or in a line with the beam.</p>

<p>ABUT. When two timbers or planks are united endways, they are
said to <i>butt</i> or <i>abut</i> against each other. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BUTT">Butt</a></span>.)</p>

<p>ABYME. Places supposed to be the site of constant whirlpools, such as
Charybdis, the Maelstrom, and others. It means generally an abyss.</p>

<p>ABYSS. A deep mass of waters; in hydrography it was synonymous
with <i>gulf</i>.</p>

<p>ACADEMITE. An old term for an officer brought up at the Royal
Navy Academy at Portsmouth, afterwards named the Royal Naval

<p>ACAIR-PHUILL. Compounded of the British <i>acair</i> or anchor, and
<i>phuill</i>, a pill, or harbour, and means a safe anchorage.</p>

<p>ACALEPH&AElig;. A class of marine animals of low organization, having
a translucent jelly-like structure, and frequently possessing the property
of stinging, whence their name (<span title="akal&ecirc;ph&ecirc;">&#7936;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8053;&#966;&#951;</span>, a nettle). The common
jelly-fish (<i>Medusa</i>) and the Portuguese man-of-war (<i>Physalia</i>) are
the best-known examples.</p>

<p>ACAST. The old word for <i>lost</i> or <i>cast-away</i>. In weighing anchor the
head-yards are generally braced <i>acast</i>, to cause the vessel to cast in
the direction. "Does she take <i>acast</i>?" is frequently the question of
the officer abaft.</p>

<p><a name="ACATER" id="ACATER"></a>ACATER. An old word for purveyor of victuals, whence <i>caterer</i>, or
superintendent and provider of a mess. Thus in Ben Jonson's "The Devil
is an Ass"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;">

<p><a name="ACCELERATION" id="ACCELERATION"></a>ACCELERATION. The increase of velocity in a moving body by the
force of gravity. A planet is said to be accelerated when its actual
diurnal motion exceeds its mean. In fixed stars the acceleration is
the mean time by which they anticipate the sun's diurnal revolution,
which is 3&#8242; 56&#8243; nearly.&mdash;<i>Acceleration of the moon</i> is the increase of her
mean motion, caused by a slow change in the excentricity of the terrestrial

<p>ACTING COMMISSION. When a commissioned officer is invalided,
his vacancy is filled up pending the pleasure of the admiralty by an
acting order. But when an officer dies on a station, where the
admiralty delegates the power to the admiral commanding in chief,
the vacancy is filled by an acting commission. Thus also rear-admirals
now act on acting commissions as vice-admirals during
command on their station, but return to their proper position on the
navy list when it ceases.</p>

fleet. It is indeed the duty performed by first lieutenants.</p>

<p>ADMEASUREMENT. The calculation of proportions according to

of a ship.</p>

<p>ADMIRAL. The derivation of this noble title from the Greek <i>almyros</i>,
from the Latin <i>admirabilis</i>, from the Saxon <i>aenmereeal</i>, and from the
French <i>aumer</i>, appear all fanciful. It is extensively received that
the Sicilians first adopted it from <i>emir</i>, the sea, of their Saracen
masters; but it presents a kind of unusual etymological inversion.
The term is most frequent in old Romance; but the style and title was
not used by us until 1286; and in 1294, William de Leybourne was
designated "Amiral de la Mer du Roy d'Angleterre;" six years afterwards
Viscount Narbonne was constituted Admiral of France; which
dates nearly fix the commencement of the two states as maritime
powers.</p>

<p class="in1">The <i>admiral</i> is the chief commander of a fleet, but of this rank
there are three degrees, distinguished by a flag at the fore, main, or
mizen mast, according to the title of <i>admiral</i>, <i>vice-admiral</i>, or <i>rear-admiral</i>.
These were again subdivided according to their colour of red,
white, or blue, which had to be likewise borne by the squadrons they
respectively commanded. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#FLAG">Flag</a></span>.) In 1865 the colours were
omitted, and the only flag now hoisted by ships of war is the white St.
George's ensign, and for admirals the white St. George's cross at the
main, fore, or mizen.</p>

<p class="in1">The <i>admiral of the fleet</i> is the highest officer under the admiralty
of Great Britain; it is rather an honorary distinction, and usually
attained by seniority and service: when this officer serves afloat, he
hoists the proud distinction of the Union flag at the main.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p class="in1">The <i>lord high-admiral</i> was one of the principal officers of the state,
who formerly decided all cases relating to the sea: he wore a gold call
and chain, similar in form to that which has descended to the boatswain
and his mate. This dignity has been extinct for many years,
and the duty merged into that of the lords-commissioners and admiralty
court; in 1827, it was revived for a short time in the person
of His Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence.</p>

<p class="in1">The epithet of <i>admiral</i> was also formerly applied to any large or
leading ship, without reference to flag; and is still used for the principal
vessel in the cod and whale fisheries. That which arrives first in any
port of Newfoundland retains this title during the season, with certain
rights of beach in flakes. The master of the second ship becomes the
vice-admiral, and the master of the third the rear-admiral.</p>

<p>ADMIRAL. A beautiful and rare shell of the genus <i>Conus</i>; the
varieties are designated the grand-admiral, the vice-admiral, the
orange-admiral, and the extra-admiral.</p>

<p>ADMIRALTY. An office for the administration of naval affairs, presided
over by a lord high-admiral, whether the duty be discharged by
one person, or by commissioners under the royal patent, who are styled
lords, and during our former wars generally consisted of seven. The
present constitution of the Board of Admiralty comprises&mdash;the first
lord, a minister and civilian as to office; four naval lords; one civil
lord attending to accounts, &amp;c.; one chief secretary; one second secretary.
Two lords and one secretary form a legal Board of Admiralty
wherever they may be assembled, under the authority of the board or
its chief.</p>

<p>ADMIRALTY BLACK-BOOK. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BLACK-BOOK">Black-book</a></span>.</p>

<p><a name="ADMIRALTY_COURT" id="ADMIRALTY_COURT"></a>ADMIRALTY COURT. The constitution of this court relatively to
the legislative power of the king in council, is analogous to that of the
courts of common law relatively to the parliament of the kingdom.&mdash;<i>High
Court of Admiralty</i>, a supreme court of law, in which the
authority of the lord high-admiral is ostensibly exercised in his <i>judicial</i>
capacity for the trial of maritime causes of a civil nature.
Although termed the High Court of Admiralty, more properly this is
the Court of Vice-Admiralty, and relates solely to civil and military
matters of the sea, and sea boundaries, prizes, collisions, vessels or
goods cast on the shore where the vice-admirals have civil jurisdiction,
but no naval power, as the lord-lieutenants of counties are named in
their patents "vice-admirals of the same;" in like manner all governors
of colonies. All cases in connection are tried by the Admiralty Court
in London, or by our "courts of vice-admiralty and prize jurisdictions
abroad." Admirable as some of the decisions of this expensive tribunal
have been, it has all the powers of the Inquisition in its practice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and has thereby been an instrument of persecution to some innocent
navigators, while it has befriended notorious villains. Besides this we
have the Admiralty Court of Oyer and Terminer, for the trial of all
murders, piracies, or criminal acts which occur within the limits of the
country, on the coast-lines, at sea, or wherever the admiralty jurisdiction
extends&mdash;the deck of a British ship included.</p>

<p>ADMIRALTY MIDSHIPMAN. Formerly one who, having served
the appointed time, and passed his examination for lieutenant, was
appointed to a ship by the admiralty, and thus named in contradistinction

the customs of the naval service.</p>

<p>ADZE, <span class="sm1">or Addice</span>. A cutting tool of the axe kind, for dubbing
flat and circular work, much used by shipwrights, especially by the
Parsee builders in India, with whom it serves for axe, plane, and
chisel. It is a curious fact that from the polar regions to the
equator, and southerly throughout Polynesia, this instrument and its
peculiar adaptations, whether made of iron, basalt, nephrite, &amp;c.,
all preserve the same idea or identity of conception.</p>

<p>&AElig;INAUT&AElig;. Senators of Miletus, who held their deliberations on

<p><a name="AFEARD" id="AFEARD"></a>AFEARD. This is a very common expression for <i>afraid</i>, and though

word.</p>

<p>AFER. The south-west wind of the Latins, and used by some of the
early voyagers.</p>

<p><a name="AFFECTIONATE_FRIENDS" id="AFFECTIONATE_FRIENDS"></a>AFFECTIONATE FRIENDS. An official inconsistent subscription,
even to letters of reproof and imprest, used by the former Board of
Commissioners of the Navy to such officers as were not of noble
families or bore titles; the only British board that ever made so
mean a distinction, equally kind with the regrets of the clergy on
burning a heretic, or those of Walton in cutting a live fish <i>tenderly</i>.
It was probably adopted from James, Duke of York, who, when lord
high-admiral, always so subscribed his official letters. It is said that
this practice was discontinued in consequence of a distinguished
naval captain&mdash;a knight&mdash;adding, "your affectionate friend." He was
thereupon desired to "discontinue such an expression," when he
replied, "I am, gentlemen, no longer your affectionate friend,
J. Phillimore."</p>

right angle to the ship's keel to the horizon forward.</p>

<p>AFOUNDRIT. An archaism of <i>sunk</i> or <i>foundered</i>.</p>

<p>AFT&mdash;a Saxon word contradistinctive of <i>fore</i>, and an abbreviation of
<i>abaft</i>&mdash;the hinder part of the ship, or that nearest the stern.&mdash;<i>Right
aft</i> is in a direct line with the keel from the stern.&mdash;<i>To haul aft a

masts. Opposed to <i>fore</i>.</p>

<p>AFTER-BODY. That part of the ship's hull which is abaft the midships
or dead-flat, as seen from astern. The term is, however, more
particularly used in expressing the <i>figure</i> or <i>shape</i> of that part of the
ship. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#DEAD-FLAT">Dead-flat</a></span>.)</p>

<p>AFTER-CLAP. Whatever disagreeable occurrence takes place after
the consequences of the cause were thought at an end; a principal
application being when a ship, supposed to have struck, opens her fire
again. This is a very old English word, alluding to unexpected events

Hubbard's Tale"&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="AGAL-AGAL" id="AGAL-AGAL"></a>AGAL-AGAL. One of the sea fuci, forming a commercial article from
the Malay Isles to China, where it is made into a strong cement. The

It is now found in great abundance throughout the Polynesian
Islands, Mauritius, &amp;c. It is soluble, and forms a clear jelly&mdash;used

horizon.&mdash;<i>Meridian altitude.</i> The arc of the meridian,&mdash;or greater
or less altitude, measured from the horizon, of a celestial object in its
passage over the meridian, above or below the pole, of the place of the
observer. In Polar regions two such transits of the sun, and in
England similarly, circumpolar stars afford double observations for the
determination of time or latitude. The general term is understood by
seamen to denote mid-day, when the passage and meridian altitude of
the sun affords the latitude.&mdash;<i>True altitude</i> is that produced by
correcting the apparent one for parallax and refraction.</p>

to an enemy for "yield," and was written <i>amayne</i> and <i>almayne</i>. Its
literal signification is, with force or vigour, all at once, suddenly; and
it is generally used to anything which is moved by a tackle-fall, as
"lower amain!" let run at once. When we used to demand the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
salute in the narrow seas, the lowering of the top-sail was called
<i>striking amain</i> (<i>see</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#STRIKE">Strike</a></span>), and it was demanded by the <i>wave

use is to second the shrouds in supporting the mast when strained by
a weight of sail in a fresh wind. They are usually distinguished into
breast and after backstays; the first being intended to sustain the
mast when the ship sails upon a wind; or, in other terms, when the
wind acts upon a ship obliquely from forwards; the second is to enable
her to carry sail when the wind is abaft the beam; a third, or shifting

<p>BALANCE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To contract a sail into a narrower compass;&mdash;this is
peculiar to the mizen of a ship, and to the main-sail of those vessels
wherein it is extended by a boom. The operation of balancing the
mizen is performed by lowering the yard or gaff a little, then rolling
up a small portion of the sail at the peak or upper corner, and lashing
it about one-fifth down towards the mast. A boom main-sail is
balanced by rolling up a portion of the clew, or lower aftermost corner,
and fastening it strongly to the boom.&mdash;N.B. It is requisite in both
cases to wrap a piece of old canvas round the sail, under the lashing,

the clew, so that it may be reefed either way&mdash;by lacing the foot or
lower half; or by lacing the gaff drooped to the band: the latter is
only done in the worst weather.&mdash;This is a point on which seamen may
select&mdash;but the old plan, as first given, affords more power; (2) is applicable
to the severest weather.</p>

</div>

<p>BALLAST. A certain portion of stone, pig-iron, gravel, water, or such
like materials, deposited in a ship's hold when she either has no cargo
or too little to bring her sufficiently low in the water. It is used to
counter-balance the effect of the wind upon the masts, and give the
ship a proper stability, that she may be enabled to carry sail without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
danger of overturning. The art of ballasting consists in placing the
centre of gravity, so as neither to be too high nor too low, too far forward
nor too far aft, and that the surface of the water may nearly rise
to the extreme breadth amidships, and thus the ship will be enabled
to carry a good sail, incline but little, and ply well to windward. A
want of true knowledge in this department has led to putting too great
a weight in ships' bottoms, which impedes their sailing and endangers
their masts by excessive rolling, the consequence of bringing the centre
of gravity too low. It should be trimmed with due regard to the
capacity, gravity, and flooring, and to the nature of whatever is to be
deposited thereon. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#TRIM">Trim</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a name="BALLISTIC_PENDULUM" id="BALLISTIC_PENDULUM"></a>BALLISTIC PENDULUM. An instrument for determining the
velocity of projectiles. The original pendulum was of very massive
construction, the arc through which it receded when impinged on by
the projectile, taking into account their respective weights, afforded,
with considerable calculation, a measure of the velocity of impact.
Latterly the electro-ballistic pendulum, which by means of electric
currents is made to register with very great accuracy the time occupied
by the projectile in passing over a measured space, has superseded it,
as being more accurate, less cumbrous, and less laborious in its accompanying
calculations.</p>

<p>BAR, <span class="sm2">OF A PORT OR HARBOUR</span>. An accumulated shoal or bank of sand,
shingle, gravel, or other uliginous substances, thrown up by the sea
to the mouth of a river or harbour, so as to endanger, and sometimes
totally prevent, the navigation into it.&mdash;<i>Bars of rivers</i> are some shifting
and some permanent. The position of the bar of any river may
commonly be guessed by attending to the form of the shores at the
embouchure. The shore on which the deposition of sediment is going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
on will be flat, whilst the opposite one is steep. It is along the side
of the latter that the deepest channel of the river lies; and in the
line of this channel, but without the points that form the mouth of
the river, will be the <i>bar</i>. If both the shores are of the same nature,
which seldom happens, the bar will lie opposite the middle of the
channel. Rivers in general have what may be deemed a bar, in
respect of the depth of the channel within, although it may not rise
high enough to impede the navigation&mdash;for the increased deposition
that takes place when the current slackens, through the want of
declivity, and of shores to retain it, must necessarily form a bank.
Bars of small rivers may be deepened by means of stockades to confine
the river current, and prolong it beyond the natural points of the
river's mouth. They operate to remove the place of deposition further
out, and into deeper water. Bars, however, act as breakwaters in
most instances, and consequently secure smooth water within them.
The deposit in all curvilinear or serpentine rivers will always be found
at the point opposite to the curve into which the ebb strikes and
rebounds, deepening the hollow and depositing on the tongue. Therefore
if it be deemed advisable to change the position of a bar, it may
be in some cases aided by works projected on the last curve sea-ward.
By such means a parallel canal may be forced which will admit
vessels under the cover of the bar.&mdash;<i>Bar</i>, a boom formed of huge trees,
or spars lashed together, moored transversely across a port, to prevent
entrance or egress.&mdash;<i>Bar</i>, the short bits of bar-iron, about half a pound

have been the famous barge or galley of Cleopatra, which, according to
the beautiful description of Shakspeare&mdash;</p>

geese. They belong to the order of <i>Cirripeds</i>.</p>

<p>BARNAGH. The Manx or Gaelic term for a limpet.</p>

<p><a name="BAROMETER" id="BAROMETER"></a>BAROMETER. A glass tube of 36 inches in length, filled with the
open end upwards with refined mercury&mdash;thus boiled and suddenly
inverted into a cistern, which is furnished with a leathern bag, on
which the atmosphere, acting by its varying weight, presses the fluid
metal up to corresponding heights in the tube, easily read off by an
external scale attached thereto. By attentive observations on this
simple prophet, practised seamen are enabled to foretell many approaching
changes of wind or weather, and thus by shortening sail in time,
save hull, spars, and lives. This instrument also affords the means of
accurately determining the heights or depressions of mountains and
valleys. This is the <i>mercurial</i> barometer; another, the <i>aneroid</i> barometer,
invented by Monsr. Vidi, measures approximately, but not
with the permanence of the mercurial. It is constructed to measure
the weight of a column of air or pressure of the atmosphere, by pressure
on a very delicate metallic box hermetically sealed. It is more
sensible to passing changes, but not so reliable as the mercurial
barometer. 29&middot;60 is taken as the mean pressure in England; as it
rises or falls below this mark, fine weather or strong winds may be
looked for:&mdash;30&middot;60 is very high, and 29&middot;00 very low. The barometer
is affected by the direction of the wind, thus N.N.E. is the highest,
and S.S.W. the lowest&mdash;therefore these matters govern the decision of
men of science, who are not led astray by the change of reading alone.
The seaman pilot notes the heavens; the direction of the wind&mdash;and
the pressure due to that direction&mdash;not forgetting sudden changes of
temperature. Attention is due to the surface, whether convex or
concave.</p>

of the ancient galleys, with which they pierced their enemies. Pis&aelig;us
is said to have first added the rostrum or beak-head. Later it was
a small platform at the fore part of the upper deck, but the term is
now applied to that part without the ship before the forecastle, or
knee of the head, which is fastened to the stem and is supported by
the main knee. Latterly, to meet steam propulsion, the whole of this
is enlarged, strengthened, and armed with iron plates, and thus the
armed stem revives the ancient strategy in sea-fights. Shakspeare
makes Ariel thus allude to the beak in the "Tempest:"&mdash;</p>

We bore down upon the enemy; <i>i.e.</i> having the advantage of the wind,
or being to windward, we approached the enemy by sailing large, or
from the wind. When a ship that was to windward comes under
another ship's stern, and so gives her the wind, she is said to bear
under the lee; often as a mark of respect. She bears in with the

<p>BILGE-KEELS. Used for vessels of very light draught and flattish
bottoms, to make them hold a better wind, also to support them upright
when grounded. The <i>Warrior</i> and other iron-clads are fitted
with bilge-keels.</p>

<p>BILGE-KEELSONS. These are fitted inside of the bilge, to afford
strength where iron, ores, and other heavy cargo are shipped. Otherwise

<p>BILGE-PLANKS. Certain thick strengthenings on the inner and
outer lines of the bilge, to secure the <i>shiftings</i> as well as bilge-keels.</p>

<p>BILGE-PUMP. A small pump used for carrying off the water which
may lodge about the lee-bilge, so as not to be under the action of the
main pumps. In a steamer it is worked by a single link off one of
the levers.</p>

<p>BILGE-TREES. Another name for bilge-coads.</p>

<p>BILGE-WATER. The rain or sea-water which occasionally enters a
vessel, and running down to her floor, remains in the bilge of the ship
till pumped out, by reason of her flat bottom, which prevents it from
going to the well of the pump; it is always (especially if the ship does
not leak) of a dirty colour and disgusting penetrating smell. It seems
to have been a sad nuisance in early voyages; and in the earliest sea-ballad
known (<i>temp.</i> Hen. VI.) it is thus grumbled at:&mdash;</p>

from the French term <i>habittacle</i>, a small habitation, which is now used
for the same purpose by the seamen of that nation. The binnacle is
a wooden case or box, which contains the compass, and a light to illuminate
the compass at night; there are usually three binnacles on the
deck of a ship-of-war, two near the helm being designed for the man
who steers, weather and lee, and the other amidships, 10 or 12 feet
before these, where the quarter-master, who conns the ship, stands

for, says a maritime proverb, a master must know the capacity of his
vessel, as well as a rider the strength of his horse.</p>

<p>BISCUIT [<i>i.e.</i> <i>bis coctus</i>, or Fr. <i>bis-cuit</i>]. Bread intended for naval or
military expeditions is now simply flour well kneaded, with the least
possible quantity of water, into flat cakes, and slowly baked. Pliny
calls it <i>panis nauticus</i>; and of the <i>panis militaris</i>, he says that it
was heavier by one-third than the grain from which it was made.</p>

<p>BISHOP. A name of the great northern diver (<i>Colymbus glacialis</i>).</p>

<p>BISMER. A name of the stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus spinachia</i>).</p>

<p>BIT. A West Indian silver coin, varying from 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> In America
it is 12<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> cents, and in the Spanish settlements is equal with the real,
or one-eighth of a dollar. It was, in fact, Spanish money cut into bits,
and known as "cut-money."</p>

<p>BITE. Is said of the anchor when it holds fast in the ground on reaching
it. Also, the hold which the short end of a lever has upon the
thing to be lifted. Also, to bite off the top of small-arm cartridges.</p>

<p>BITTER. Any turn of a cable about the bitts is called a bitter. Hence
a ship is "brought up to a bitter" when the cable is allowed to run
out to that stop.</p>

<p>BITTER-BUMP. A north-country name for the bittern.</p>

<p>BITTER-END. That part of the cable which is abaft the bitts, and
therefore within board when the ship rides at anchor. They say,
"Bend to the bitter-end" when they would have that end bent to the
anchor, and when a chain or rope is paid out to the bitter-end, no
more remains to be let go. The bitter-end is the clinching end&mdash;sometimes
that end is bent to the anchor, because it has never been
used, and is more trustworthy. The first 40 fathoms of a cable of
115 fathoms is generally worn out when the inner end is comparatively
new.</p>

<p>BITT-HEADS. The upright pieces of oak-timber let in and bolted to
the beams of two decks at least, and to which the cross-pieces are let
on and bolted. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BITTS">Bitts</a></span>.)</p>

<p>BITT-PINS. Similar to belaying-pins, but larger. Used to prevent

fixed upright in the fore-part of a ship, and bolted securely to the
beams, whereon to fasten the cables as she rides at anchor; in ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of war there are usually two pairs of cable-bitts, and when they are
both used at once the cable is said to be double-bitted. Since the introduction
of chain-cables, bitts are coated with iron, and vary in their
shapes. There are several other smaller bitts; as, the topsail-sheet
bitts, paul-bitts, carrick-bitts, windlass-bitts, winch-bitts, jear-bitts,
riding-bitts, gallows-bitts, and fore-brace bitts.</p>

<p>BITT-STOPPER. One rove through the knee of the bitts, which nips
the cable on the bight: it consists of four or five fathoms of rope tailed
out nipper fashion at one end, and clench-knotted at the other. The
old bitt-stopper, by its running loop on a standing end, bound the
cable down in a bight abaft the bitts&mdash;the tail twisted round the fore
part helped to draw it still closer. It is now disused&mdash;chain cables
having superseded hemp.</p>

<p>BITT THE CABLE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To put it round the bitts, in order to fasten
it, or slacken it out gradually, which last is called veering away.</p>

Cape of Good Hope, in which the vapoury clouds called the Devil's
Table-cloth appear on Table Mountain.</p>

<p>BLACK SQUALL. This squall, although generally ascribed to the
West Indies, as well as the white squall, may be principally ascribed
to a peculiar heated state of the atmosphere near land. As blackey,
when interrogated about weather, generally observes, "Massa, look to
leeward," it may be easily understood that it is the condensed air
repelled by a colder medium to leeward, and driven back with condensed
electricity and danger. So it is sudden to Johnny Newcomes,
who lose sails, spars, and ships, by capsizing.</p>

<p>BLACK'S THE WHITE OF MY EYE. When Jack avers that
no one can say this or that of him. It is an indignant expression of
innocence of a charge.</p>

in a ship's side; they are always covered with a mixture of tar and
lamp-black, which not only preserves them from the heat of the sun
and the weather, but forms an agreeable variety with the painted or
varnished parts above them. Vessels with no ports have frequently
two such strakes&mdash;one above, the other below the wales, the latter
being also called the diminishing strake.</p>

<p>BLACK-STRAP. The dark country wines of the Mediterranean. Also,
bad port, such as was served for the sick in former times.</p>

<p>BLACK-TANG. The sea-weed <i>Fucus vesicolosus</i>, or tangle.</p>

receive the palm.</p>

<p>BLADE <span class="sm2">OR</span> WASH OF AN OAR. Is the flat part of it which is
plunged into the water in rowing. The force and effect in a great
measure depends on the length of this part, when adequate force is
applied. When long oars are used, the boat is generally single-banked,
so that the fulcrum is removed further from the rower. Also, the
motive part of the screw-propeller.</p>

<p>BLAE, <span class="sm1">or Blea</span>. The alburnum or sap-wood of timber.</p>

<p>BLAKE. Yellow. North of England.</p>

half-dried fish.</p>

<p>BLOCCO. Paper and hair used in paying a vessel's bottom.</p>

<p><a name="BLOCK" id="BLOCK"></a>BLOCK. (In mechanics termed a pulley.) Blocks are flattish oval
pieces of wood, with sheaves in them, for all the running ropes to run
in. They are used for various purposes in a ship, either to increase
the mechanical power of the ropes, or to arrange the ends of them in
certain places on the deck, that they may be readily found when
wanted; they are consequently of various sizes and powers, and obtain
various names, according to their form or situation, thus:&mdash;A single
block contains only one sheave or wheel. A double block has two
sheaves. A treble or threefold block, three, and so on. A long-tackle
or fiddle-block has two sheaves&mdash;one below the other, like a
fiddle. Cistern or sister block for top-sail lifts and reef tackles. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
block is composed of three, and generally four, parts:&mdash;(1.) The shell,
or outside wooden part. (2.) The sheave, or wheel, on which the rope
runs. (3.) The pin, or axle, on which the sheave turns. (4.) The
strop, or part by which the block is made fast to any particular station,
and is usually made either of rope or of iron. Blocks are named and
distinguished by the ropes which they carry, and the uses they serve
for, as bowlines, braces, clue-lines, halliards, &amp;c. &amp;c. They are
either <i><a href="#MADE_MASTS">made</a></i> or <i><a href="#MORTICE">morticed</a></i> (which see).</p>

<p>BLOCK. The large piece of elm out of which the figure is carved at
the head of the ship.</p>

<p>BLOCKADE. The investment of a town or fortress by sea and land;
shutting up all the avenues, so that it can receive no relief.&mdash;<i>To
blockade a port</i> is to prevent any communication therewith by sea,
and cut off supplies, in order to compel a surrender when the provisions
and ammunition are exhausted.&mdash;<i>To raise a blockade</i> is to discontinue
it.&mdash;Blockade is violated by egress as well as by ingress.
Warning on the spot is sufficient notice of a blockade <i>de facto</i>. Declaration
is useless without actual investment. If a ship break a
blockade, though she escape the blockading force, she is, if taken in
any part of her future voyage, captured <i>in delicto</i>, and subject to confiscation.
The absence of the blockading force removes liability, and
<i>might</i> (in such cases) overrules <i>right</i>.</p>

<p><a name="BLOCK_AND_BLOCK" id="BLOCK_AND_BLOCK"></a>BLOCK AND BLOCK. The situation of a tackle when the blocks
are drawn close together, so that the mechanical power becomes
arrested until the tackle is again overhauled by drawing the blocks
asunder. Synonymous with chock-a-block.</p>

<p>BLOCKHOUSE. A small work, generally built of logs, to protect
adjacent ports. Blockhouses were primarily constructed in our
American colonies, because they could be immediately built from
the heavy timber felled to clear away the spot, and open the lines
of fire. The ends were simply crossed alternately and pinned. Two
such structures, with a space of 6 feet for clay, formed, on an elevated
position, a very formidable casemated work. The slanting overhanging
roof furnished excellent cover in lieu of loop-holes for musketry.</p>

<p>BLOCK-MAKER. A manufacturer of blocks.</p>

<p>BLOCKS. The several transverse pieces or logs of timber, piled in
plane, on which a ship is built, or to place her on for repair: they
consist of solid pieces of oak laid on the ground-ways.</p>

<p>BLOCKS, FIXED. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#FIXED_BLOCKS">Fixed Blocks</a></span>.</p>

<p>BLOOD-SUCKERS. Lazy fellows, who, by skulking, throw their proportion
of labour on the shoulders of their shipmates.</p>

<p>BLOUT. A northern term for the sudden breaking-up of a storm.
Blout has been misused for blirt.</p>

<p>BLOWE. A very old English word for scold or revile, still in use, as
when a man receives a good blowing-up.</p>

<p>BLOW-HOLES. The nostrils of the cetaceans, situated on the highest

sailing against the direction of the wind.&mdash;<i>To make a good board.</i> To
sail in a straight line when close-hauled, without deviating to leeward.&mdash;<i>To
make short boards</i>, is to tack frequently before the ship has run
any great length of way.&mdash;<i>To make a stern board</i>, is when by a current,
or any other accident, the vessel comes head to wind, the helm
is shifted, and she has fallen back on the opposite tack, losing what
she had gained, instead of having advanced beyond it. To make a
stern board is frequently a very critical as well as seamanlike operation,
as in very close channels. The vessel is allowed to run up into
the wind until she has shot up to the weather danger; the helm is
then shifted, and with all aback forward, she falls short off on the
opposite tack. Such is also achieved at anchor in <a href="#CLUB-HAUL">club-hauling</a> (which
see).&mdash;<i>To board a ship</i>, is to enter her in a hostile manner in order to
take forcible possession of her, either from the attacking ship or by

about 2 feet long, with a sharp head, small mouth, full eyes,
and a regular semi-lunar tail.</p>

<p>BONI-VOCHIL. The Hebridean name for the great northern diver
(<i>Colymbus glacialis</i>).</p>

<p>BONNET. An additional part laced to the foot of the jibs, or other
fore-and-aft sails, in small vessels in moderate weather, to gather more
wind. They are commonly one-third of the depth of the sails they
belong to. Thus we say, "Lace on the bonnet," or "Shake off the
bonnet." Bonnets have lately been introduced to secure the foot of
an upper-topsail to a lower-topsail yard. The unbonnetted sail is for
storm service. Bonnet, in fortification, is a raised portion of the works
at any salient angle, having the same plan, but 10 or 12 feet more
command than the work on which it is based. It assists in protecting
from enfilade, and affords a plunging fire.</p>

<p>BOOBY. A well-known tropical sea-bird, <i>Sula fusca</i>, of the family
<i>Pelecanid&aelig;</i>. It is fond of resting out of the water at night, even
preferring an unstable perch on the yard of a ship. The name is
derived from the way in which it allows itself to be caught immediately
after settling. The direction in which they fly as evening comes on
often shows where land may be found.</p>

<p>BOOBY-HATCH. A smaller kind of companion, but readily removable;
it is in use for merchantmen's half decks, and lifts off in one piece.</p>

<p><a name="BOOMING" id="BOOMING"></a>BOOMING. Sound of distant guns; it is often, but wrongly, applied
to the hissing or whistling of shot.</p>

<p><a name="BOOM-IRONS" id="BOOM-IRONS"></a>BOOM-IRONS. Are metal rings fitted on the yard-arms, through
which the studding-sail booms traverse; there is one on each top-sail
yard-arm, but on the lower yards a second, which opens to allow the
boom to be triced up; it is one-fourth from the yard-arms, and holds
down the heel of the boom when it is rigged out.</p>

<p>BOOM-JIGGER. A tackle used in large ships, for rigging out or

shells, &amp;c., which adhere to the bottom, near the surface of the water,
and daubing it over with a mixture of tallow, sulphur, and resin, as a
temporary protection against worms. This is chiefly performed where
there is no dock or other commodious situation for breaming or
careening, or when the hurry of a voyage renders it inconvenient to
have the whole bottom properly trimmed and cleansed. The term is
now applied to sheathing a vessel with planking over felt.</p>

<p>BOOTY. That sort of prize which may be distributed at the capstan-head,
or at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

gorged with wine.</p>

<p>BORASCA. A storm, with thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>BORD. The sea-coast, an old term. Formerly meant the side, edge, or
brim; hence, as applied to a ship, to throw overboard, is to cast anything
over the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>BORDELS. An old word for houses built along a strand. In the old

<p><a name="BORE" id="BORE"></a>BORE. A sudden and rapid flow of tide in certain inlets of the sea; as
the monstrous wave in the river Hooghly, called <i>bahu</i> by the natives,
which rolls in with the noise of distant thunder at flood-tide. It
occurs from February to November, at the new and full moon. Its
cause has not been clearly defined, although it probably arises from the
currents during spring-tides, acting on a peculiar conformation of the
banks and bed of the river; it strikes invariably on the same part of
the banks, majestically rolling over to one side, and passing on
diagonally to the other with impetuous violence. The bore also occurs
in England, near Bristol; and in America, in several rivers, but especially
in the Bay of Fundy, where at the river Petticodiac the tide
rises 76 feet. It also occurs in Borneo and several rivers in the
East. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#HYGRE">Hygre</a></span>.) Also, the interior cavity of a piece of ordnance,
generally cylindrical in shape, except when a part of it is modified
into a chamber.</p>

<p>BORHAME. A northern term for the flounder.</p>

<p>BORING. In Arctic seas, the operation of forcing the ship through

birth or connection, has all the usual obstacles to advancement cleared
away for him. Those who toil unceasingly for preferment, and toil in
vain, are said to have been born with a wooden ladle. Again, the
silver-spoon gentry are said to come on board through the cabin
windows; those less favoured, over the bows, or through the
hawse-holes.</p>

<p>BORNE. Placed on the books for victuals and wages; also supernumerary
and "for rank."</p>

<p>BORROW, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To approach closely either to land or wind; to hug a

of the smaller cetaceans of the northern seas, more especially to the
<i>Hyperoodon rostratus</i>.</p>

<p>BOTTOM. A name for rich low land formed by alluvial deposits: but
in a general sense it denotes the lowest part of a thing, in contradistinction
to the top or uppermost part. In navigation, it is used to
denote as well the channel of rivers and harbours as the body or hull
of a ship. Thus, in the former sense we say "a gravelly bottom,
clayey bottom," &amp;c., and in the latter sense "a British bottom, a
Dutch bottom," &amp;c. By statute, certain commodities imported in
foreign bottoms pay a duty called "petty customs," over and above
what they are liable to if imported in British bottoms. Bottom of a
ship or boat is that part which is below the wales.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>BOTTOM-CLEAN. Thoroughly clean, free from weeds, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="BOTTOMREE" id="BOTTOMREE"></a>BOTTOMREE, <span class="sm1">or Bottomry-bond</span>. The contract of bottomry is a
negotiable instrument, which may be put in suit by the person to
whom it is transferred: it is in use in all countries of maritime commerce
and interests. A contract in the nature of a mortgage of a
ship, when the owner of it borrows money to enable him to carry on
the voyage, and pledge the keel, or bottom of the ship, as a security for
the repayment. If the ship be lost the lender also loses his whole
money; but if it return in safety then he shall receive back his
principal, and also the premium stipulated to be paid, however it may
exceed the usual or legal rate of interest. The affair is, however,
only regarded as valid upon the ground of necessity; and thus exacting
more than the interest allowed by law is not deemed usury.</p>

<p>BOTTOMRY PREMIUM. A high rate of interest charged on the
safety of the ship&mdash;the lender losing his whole money if she be lost.</p>

<p>BOTTOM-WIND. A phenomenon that occurs on the lakes in the
north of England, especially Derwent Water, which is often agitated

cask stowed against the bilge of another. To prepare a ship for the
purpose of sinking it.</p>

<p>BOUILLI. Termed by seamen bully-beef; disliked because all the
substance is boiled away to enrich the cook's grease-tub, and the meat
is useless as food; rejected even by dogs. In one ship of war it produced
mutiny; vide Adams' account of the <i>Bounty</i> miseries. It is
also the name given to highly cooked meat in hermetically sealed
tin canisters.</p>

<p>BOULDER-HEAD. A work against the encroachment of the sea,
made of wooden stakes.</p>

<p>BOULDERS. Stones worn and rounded by the attrition of the waves
of the sea: the word, on the authority of Hunter, was considered a
technical term in the fourteenth century, as appears in a warrant of
John of Gaunt for the repair of Pontefract Castle&mdash;"De peres, appel&eacute;s
buldres, a n're dit chastel come nous semblerez resonables pur la
defense de meisme."</p>

<p><a name="BOULEPONGES" id="BOULEPONGES"></a>BOULEPONGES. A drink to which many of the deaths of Europeans
in India were ascribed; but in Bernier's "Travels," in the train of
Aurungzebe, in 1664, we are informed that "bouleponge is a beverage
made of arrack, sugar, lemon-juice, and a little muscadine." Probably
a corruption of bowls of punch. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#PUNCH">Punch</a></span>.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>BOW. The fore-end of a ship or boat; being the rounding part of a
vessel forward, beginning on both sides where the planks arch inwards,
and terminating where they close, at the rabbet of the stem or prow,
being larboard or starboard from that division. A bold bow is broad
and round; a lean bow, narrow and thin.&mdash;<i>On the bow.</i> An arc of the

only one large graduated arc of 90&deg;, three vanes, and a shank or staff.
Also the bow of yew, a weapon of our early fleets.</p>

<p>BOW. <i>She bows to the breeze</i>; when the sails belly out full, and the
ship inclines and goes ahead, pitching or bowing over the blue waves.</p>

<p>BOW-BYE. The situation of a ship when, in stays, she falls back off
the wind again, and gets into irons, which demands practical seamanship
for her extrication. This was deemed a lubberly act in our
fleets of old.</p>

<p>BOW-CHASERS. Two long chase-guns placed forward in the bow-ports
to fire directly ahead, and being of small bore for their length,
carry shot to a great distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="BOWER-ANCHORS" id="BOWER-ANCHORS"></a>BOWER-ANCHORS. Those at the bows and in constant working use.
They are called best and small, not from a difference of size, but as to
the bow on which they are placed; starboard being the best bower,
and port the small bower. The appropriated cables assume the
respective names. (<i>See also</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#SPARE_ANCHOR">Spare Anchor</a>, <a href="#SHEET-CABLE">Sheet</a>, <a href="#STREAM-CABLE">Stream</a>, <a href="#COASTING">Coasting</a>,

<p>BOWING. An injury done to yards by too much topping, and letting
their weights hang by the lifts. The state of a top-sail yard when it
arches in the centre from hoisting it too tautly. Also of the mast
when it bellies or is crippled by injudiciously setting up the rigging
too taut.</p>

<p>BOWING THE SEA. Meeting a turbulent swell in coming to the
wind.</p>

<p><a name="BOWLINE" id="BOWLINE"></a>BOWLINE. A rope leading forward which is fastened to a space connected
by bridles to cringles on the leech or perpendicular edge of the
square sails: it is used to keep the weather-edge of the sail tight forward
and steady when the ship is close hauled to the wind; and which,
indeed, being hauled taut, enables the ship to come nearer to the
wind. Hence the ship sails on a bowline, or stands on a taut bowline.&mdash;<i>To
check or come up a bowline</i> is to slacken it when the wind
becomes large or free.&mdash;<i>To sharp or set taut a bowline</i> is to pull it as
taut as it can well bear.</p>

<p>BOWLINE-BEND. The mode of bending warps or hawsers together
by taking a bowline in the end of one rope, and passing the end of the
other through the bight, and making a bowline upon it.</p>

<p><a name="BOWLINE-BRIDLE" id="BOWLINE-BRIDLE"></a>BOWLINE-BRIDLE. The span attached to the cringles on the leech
of a square sail to which the bowline is toggled or clinched.</p>

<p>BOWLINE-CRINGLE. An eye worked into the leech-rope of a sail;
usually in that of a fore-sail two, a main-sail three, and the fore-topsails
three, but the main-topsail four. By these the sails are found in the
dark, by feeling alone.</p>

<p>BOWLINE HAUL. A hearty and simultaneous bowse. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#ONE_TWO_THREE">One!
two!! three!!!</a></span>) In hauling the bowline it is customary for the
leading man to veer, and then haul, three times in succession, singing
out one, two, three&mdash;at the last the weight of all the men is thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in together: this is followed by "belay, oh!" When the bowlines are
reported "bowlines hauled, sir," by the officer in command of the fore-part
of the ship, the hands, or the watch, return to their duties.</p>

<p>BOWLINE-KNOT. That by which the bowline-bridles were fastened
to the cringles: the bowline-knot is made by an involution of the end
and a bight upon the standing part of a rope. A further involution
makes what is termed a bowline on a bight. It is very difficult to
explain by words:&mdash;holding the rope some distance from the end by
the left hand, the end held in the right is laid on the main part, and
by a twist given screw-fashion to the right, a loop or kink is formed
inclosing this end, which is then passed behind, and back in the same
direction with the former, and then jammed home. It is rapidly done,
easily undone, and one of the most seamanlike acts, exhibiting grace
as well as power. It can be made by a man with but one arm.</p>

<p>BOW-LINES. In ship-building, longitudinal curves representing the
ship's fore-body cut in a vertical section.</p>

<p><a name="BOWSE" id="BOWSE"></a>BOWSE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To pull upon any body with a tackle, or complication of
pulleys, in order to remove it, &amp;c. Hauling upon a tack is called
"bowsing upon a tack," and when they would have the men pull all
together, they cry, "Bowse away." Also used in setting up rigging,
as "Bowse away, starboard;" "Bowse away, port." It is, however,
mostly a gun-tackle term.&mdash;<i>Bowse up the jib</i>, a colloquialism to denote
the act of tippling: it is an old phrase, and was probably derived from
the Dutch <i>buyzen</i>, to booze.</p>

<p><a name="BOWSPRIT" id="BOWSPRIT"></a>BOWSPRIT, <span class="sm1">or Bolt-sprit</span>. A large spar, ranking with a lower-mast,
projecting over the stem; beyond it extends the jib-boom, and
beyond that again the flying jib-boom. To these spars are secured
the stays of the fore-mast and of the spars above it; on these stays are
set the fore and fore-topmast staysails, the jib, and flying-jib, which
have a most useful influence in counter-balancing the pressure of the
after-sails, thereby tending to force the ship ahead instead of merely
turning her round. In former times underneath these spars were set
a sprit-sail, sprit-topsail, &amp;c.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT, <span class="sm1">Running</span>. In cutter-rigged vessels. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#CUTTER">Cutter</a></span>.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-BITTS. Are strong upright timbers secured to the beams
below the deck; they have a cross-piece bolted to them, the inner end
of the bowsprit steps between them, and is thus prevented from slipping
in. The cross-piece prevents it from canting up.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-CAP. The crance or cap on the outer end of the bowsprit,
through which the jib-boom traverses.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-GEAR. A term denoting the ropes, blocks, &amp;c., belonging
to the bowsprit.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-HEART. The heart or block of wood used to secure the
lower end of the fore-stay, through which the inner end of the jib-boom
is inserted. It is seldom, if ever, used now, an iron band round
the bowsprit, with an eye on each side for the fore-stays, being preferred.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-HORSES. The ridge-ropes which extend from the bowsprit-cap
to the knight-heads.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-LADDER. Skids over the bowsprit from the beak-head
in some ships, to enable men to run out upon the bowsprit.</p>

<p><a name="BOWSPRIT-NETTING" id="BOWSPRIT-NETTING"></a>BOWSPRIT-NETTING. The netting placed just above a vessel's
bowsprit, for stowing away the fore-topmast staysail; it is usually
lashed between the ridge-ropes.</p>

<p>BOWSPRIT-SHROUDS. Strong ropes or chains leading from nearly
the outer end of the bowsprit to the luff of the bow, giving lateral
support to that spar.</p>

<p>BOW-STAVES. Early supplied to our men-of-war.</p>

<p>BOW-TIMBERS. Those which form the bow of the ship.</p>

<p>BOX. The space between the back-board and the stern-post of a boat,
where the coxswain sits.</p>

<p>BOXES OF THE PUMPS. Each ordinary pump has an upper and
lower box, the one a fixture in the lower part of its chamber, the
other attached to the end of the spear or piston-rod; in the centre of
each box is a valve opening upwards.</p>

<p>BOXHAULING. Is an evolution by which a ship is veered sharp round
on her heel, when the object is to avoid making a great sweep. The helm
is put a-lee, the head-yards braced flat aback, the after-yards squared,
the driver taken in, and the head-sheets hauled to windward; when
she begins to gather stern-way the helm is shifted and sails trimmed.
It is only resorted to in emergencies, as a seaman never likes to see
his ship have stern-way. With much wind and sea this evolution
would be dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="BOXING" id="BOXING"></a>BOXING. A square piece of dry hard wood, used in connecting the
frame timbers. Also, the projection formerly left at the hawse-pieces,
in the wake of the hawse-holes, where the planks do not run through;
now disused. The stem is said to be boxed when it is joined to the
fore end of the keel by a side scarph. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#Boxing_of_Rudder">Boxing of Rudder</a></span>.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>BOXING OFF. Is performed by hauling the head-sheets to windward,
and laying the head-yards flat aback, to pay the ship's head out of the
wind, when the action of the helm alone is not sufficient for that purpose;
as when she is got "in irons."</p>

<p>BOX THE COMPASS, <span class="sm1">To</span>. Not only to repeat the names of the
thirty-two points in order and backwards, but also to be able to answer

<p><a name="BRACE" id="BRACE"></a>BRACE. The braces are ropes belonging to all the yards of a ship;
two to each yard, rove through blocks that are stropped to the yards,
or fastened to pendants, seized to the yard-arms. Their use is either
to square or traverse the yards horizontally; hence, <i>to brace the yard</i>,
is to bring it to either side by means of the braces. In ship-building,
braces are plates of iron, copper, or mixed metal, which are used to
bind efficiently a weakness in a vessel; as also to receive the pintles
by which the rudder is hung.</p>

<p><a name="BRACE_ABACK" id="BRACE_ABACK"></a>BRACE ABACK. To brace the yards in, so as to lay the sails aback.&mdash;<i>To
brace about</i>, to turn the yards round for the contrary tack, or in
consequence of a change of wind.&mdash;<i>To brace abox</i>, a man&#339;uvre to
insure casting the right way, by bracing the head-yards flat aback (not
square).&mdash;<i>To brace by</i>, to brace the yards in contrary directions to
each other on the different masts, to effect the stopping of the vessel.
(<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#COUNTER-BRACE">Counter-brace</a></span>.)&mdash;<i>To brace in</i>, to lay the yard less oblique, as
for a free wind, or nearly square.&mdash;<i>To brace round</i>, synonymous with
brace about.&mdash;<i>To brace sharp</i>, to cause the yards to have the smallest
possible angle with the keel, for the ship to have head-way: deemed
generally to form an angle of 20&deg; with the keel.&mdash;<i>To brace to</i>, is to
check or ease off the lee braces, and round in the weather ones, to
assist in the man&#339;uvre of tacking or wearing.&mdash;<i>To brace up</i>, or <i>brace
sharp up</i>, to lay the yards more obliquely fore and aft, by easing off
the weather-braces and hauling in the lee ones, which enables a ship
to lie as close to the wind as possible.</p>

chain, into which the yard-arm brace-blocks are spliced. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
used in the merchant service to save rope, to give the blocks more
freedom for slewing to their work, but chiefly because when the brace
is let go, the falling chain will overhaul it, making it easier to haul in
the other brace.</p>

<p>BRACE UP AND HAUL AFT! The order usually given after
being hove-to, with fore or main top-sail square or aback, and jib-sheet
flowing, <i>i.e.</i> haul aft jib-sheet, brace up the yards which had been

as they may be termed, when brailed up, are deemed furled;
unless it blows hard, when they are farther secured by gaskets.</p>

<p>BRAKE. The handle or lever by which a common ship-pump is
usually worked. It operates by means of two iron bolts, one thrust
through the inner hole of it, which bolted through forms the lever
axis in the iron crutch of the pump, and serves as the fulcrum for the
brake, supporting it between the cheeks. The other bolt connects the
extremity of the brake to the pump-spear, which draws up the spear
box or piston, charged with the water in the tube; derived from
<i>brachium</i>, an arm or lever. Also, used to check the speed of machinery
by frictional force pressing on the circumference of the largest wheel

those billows which break violently over reefs, rocks, or shallows, lying
immediately at, or under, the surface of the sea. They are distinguished
both by their appearance and sound, as they cover that part
of the sea with a perpetual foam, and produce loud roaring, very different
from what the waves usually have over a deeper bottom. Also,
a name given to those rocks which occasion the waves to break over
them.&mdash;<i>Breakers ahead!</i> the common pass-word to warn the officer of
broken water in the direction of the course. (<i>See also</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#SHIP-BREAKER">Ship-breaker</a></span>.)</p>

to quit one department of duty, to clap on to another.</p>

<p>BREAK-SHEER, <span class="sm1">To</span>. When a ship at anchor is laid in a proper position
to keep clear of her anchor, but is forced by the wind or current

to secure smooth water within, acts as a break-water.</p>

<p>BREAM. A common fresh as well as salt water fish (<i>Abramis brama</i>),
little esteemed as food.</p>

<p><a name="BREAMING" id="BREAMING"></a>BREAMING. Cleaning a ship's bottom by burning off the grass, ooze,
shells, or sea-weed, which it has contracted by lying long in harbour;
it is performed by holding kindled furze, faggots, or reeds to the
bottom, which, by melting the pitch that formerly covered it, loosens
whatever filth may have adhered to the planks; the bottom is then
covered anew with a composition of sulphur, tallow, &amp;c., which not only
makes it smooth and slippery, so as to divide the fluid more readily,
but also poisons and destroys those worms which eat through the
planks in the course of a voyage. This operation may be performed
either by laying the ship aground after the tide has ebbed from her
or by docking or careening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="BREAST-HOOKS" id="BREAST-HOOKS"></a>BREAST-HOOKS. Thick pieces of timber, incurvated into the form
of knees, and used to strengthen the fore-part of a ship, where they
are placed at different heights, directly across the stem internally, so
as to unite it with the bows on each side, and form the principal
security, supporting the hawse-pieces and strain of the cables. The
breast-hooks are strongly connected to the stem and hawse-pieces by
tree-nails, and by bolts driven from without through all, and forelocked
or clinched upon rings inside.</p>

<p>BREECHING. A strong rope passing through at the cascable of a gun,
used to secure it to the ship's side, and prevent it recoiling too much
in time of battle, also to secure it when the ship labours; it is fixed
by reeving it through a thimble stropped upon the cascable or knob
at the breech of the gun; one end is rove and clinched, and the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
is passed through the ring-bolt in the ship's side, and seized back.
The breeching is of sufficient length to let the muzzle of the cannon
come within the ship's side to be charged, or to be housed and lashed.
Clinch-shackles have superseded the ring-bolts, so that guns may be
instantly unshackled and shifted.</p>

<p>BREECHING-BOLT. Applies to the above.</p>

<p>BREECH-LOADER. A gun, large or small, charged at the breech.
The method is a very old one revived, but with such scientific modifications
as to have enormously increased the effectiveness of small-arms;

has not yet been arrived at, but with field-guns it has added largely
to accuracy of practice and facility of loading.</p>

<p>BREECH OF A CANNON. The after-end, next the vent or touch-hole.
It is the most massive part of a gun; strictly speaking, it is
all the solid metal behind the bottom of the bore. Also, the outside

alternately at certain hours, and sensibly only near the coasts; they
are occasioned by the action of the sun raising the temperature of the

the middle part of the fire-bars in a marine boiler, on either side of
which the fires are banked. Also, a narrow ridge of rock, sand, or
shingle, across the bottom of a channel, so as to occasion a shoal over
which the tide ripples. That between Mount Edgecombe and St.
Nicholas' Isle, at Plymouth, has occasioned much loss of life.</p>

<p><a name="BRIDGE-ISLET" id="BRIDGE-ISLET"></a>BRIDGE-ISLET. A portion of land which becomes insular at high-water&mdash;as
Old Woman's Isle at Bombay, and among others, the celebrated
Lindisfarne, thus <i>tidally</i> sung by Scott:&mdash;</p>

snow, but both classes are latterly blended, and the terms therefore
synonymous.</p>

<p>BRIGADE. A party or body of men detached for a special service. A
division of troops under the command of a general officer. In artillery
organization on land, a brigade is a force usually composed of more

<p><a name="BRIGANTINE" id="BRIGANTINE"></a>BRIGANTINE. A square-rigged vessel with two masts. A term
variously applied by the mariners of different European nations to a
peculiar sort of vessel of their own marine. Amongst British seamen
this vessel is distinguished by having her main-sail set nearly in the
plane of her keel, whereas the main-sails of larger ships are spread
athwart the ship's length, and made fast to a yard which hangs
parallel to the deck; but in a brig, the foremost side of the main-sail is
fastened at different heights to hoops which encircle the main-mast,
and slide up and down it as the sail is hoisted or lowered: it is extended
by a gaff above and a boom below. Brigantine is a derivative
from brig, first applied to passage-boats; in the Celtic meaning "passage
over the water." (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#HERMAPHRODITE_or_Brig_Schooner">Hermaphrodite or Brig Schooner</a></span>.)</p>

bunt, or amidships, down before all, and looped to the toggles aforesaid.
By aid of the clue-lines, reef-tackles, and buntlines, a top-sail is
taken in or quieted if the sheets carry away, but more especially by
the buntlines, as the wind has no hold then to belly the canvas.</p>

<p>BUNTLINE-SPANS. Short pieces of rope with a thimble in one end,
the other whipped; the buntlines are rove through these thimbles:
they are attached to the tie-blocks to keep the sail in the bunt when
hauled up.</p>

<p>BUNTLINE-TOGGLES. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BUNTLINES">Buntlines</a></span> and <span class="sm1"><a href="#TOGGLE">Toggle</a></span>.</p>

<p>BUNT SLAB-LINES. Reeve through a block on the slings of the
yard or under the top, and pass abaft the sail, making fast to its foot.
Their object is to lift the foot of a course so as to see underneath it,
or to prevent it from chafing. Something of the same kind is used for
top-sails, to keep them from rubbing on the stays when flapping in a
calm.</p>

<p>BUOY. A sort of close cask, or block of wood, fastened by a rope to
the anchor, to show its situation after being cast, that the ship may not
come so near it as to entangle her cable about its stock or flukes.&mdash;<i>To
buoy a cable</i> is to make fast a spar, cask, or the like, to the bight of the
cable, in order to prevent its galling or rubbing on the bottom. When
a buoy floats on the water it is said to watch. When a vessel slips
her cable she attaches a buoy to it in order afterwards to recover it.
Thus the blockading squadrons off Brest and in Basque Roads frequently
slipped, by signal, and each in beautiful order returned and
picked up their cables.&mdash;<i>To stream the buoy</i> is to let it fall from the
ship's side into the water, which is always done before the anchor is
let go, that it may not be fouled by the buoy-rope as it sinks to the
bottom.&mdash;<i>Buoys</i> of various kinds are also placed upon rocks or sand-banks
to direct mariners where to avoid danger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>BUOYANCY. Capacity for floating lightly.&mdash;<i>Centre of buoyancy</i>, in

<p>BUOYANT. The property of floating lightly on the water.</p>

<p><a name="BUOY-ROPE" id="BUOY-ROPE"></a>BUOY-ROPE. The rope which attaches the buoy to the anchor, which
should always be of sufficient strength to lift the anchor should the
cable part; it should also be little more in length than equal to the
depth of the water (at high-water) where the anchor lies.&mdash;<i>To bend the
buoy-rope</i>, pass the running eye over one fluke, take a hitch over the
other arm, and seize. Or, take a clove-hitch over the crown on each
arm or fluke, stopping the end to its own part, or to the shank.</p>

<p>BUOY-ROPE KNOT. Used where the end is lashed to the shank.
A knot made by unlaying the strands of a cable-laid rope, and also
the small strand of each large strand; and after single and double
walling them, as for a stopper-knot, worm the divisions, and round the
rope.</p>

vessel would be deemed deeply laden.</p>

<p>BURG [the Anglo-Saxon <i>burh</i>]. A word connected with fortification
in German, as in almost all the Teutonic languages of Europe. In
Arabic the same term, with the alteration of a letter, <i>burj</i>, signifies

repeated freezing of thawed snow running down over the slopes, until
at length the wave from beneath and weight above causes it to break
off and fall into the sea, or, as termed in Greenland, to calve. Thus,

<p>CALF, <span class="sm1">or Calva</span>. A Norwegian name, also used in the Hebrides, for
islets lying off islands, and bearing a similar relation to them in size
that a calf does to a cow. As the Calf at Mull and the Calf of Man.</p>

<p>CALFAT. The old word for caulking. [<i>Calfater</i>, Fr.; probably from
<i>cale</i>, wedge, and <i>faire</i>, to make.] To wedge up an opening with any

<p><a name="CALL" id="CALL"></a>CALL. A peculiar silver pipe or whistle, used by the boatswain and his
mates to attract attention, and summon the sailors to their meals or
duties by various strains, each of them appropriated to some particular
purpose, such as hoisting, heaving, lowering, veering away, belaying,
letting go a tackle-fall, sweeping, &amp;c. This piping is as attentively
observed by sailors, as the bugle or beat of drum is obeyed by soldiers.
The coxswains of the boats of French ships of war are supplied with
calls to "in bow oar," or "of all," "oars," &amp;c.</p>

<p>CALLIPERS. Bow-legged compasses, used to measure the girth of

<p>CAMBOOSE. A form of <i><a href="#CABOOSE">caboose</a></i> (which see).</p>

<p><a name="CAMELS" id="CAMELS"></a>CAMELS. All large ships are built, at St. Petersburg, in a dockyard
off the Granite Quay, where the water is shallow; therefore a number
of camels or caissons are kept at Cronstadt, for the purpose of carrying
them down the river. Camels are hollow cases of wood, constructed
in two halves, so as to embrace the keel, and lay hold of the hull of a
ship on both sides. They are first filled with water and sunk, in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to be fixed on. The water is then pumped out, when the vessel
gradually rises, and the process is continued until the ship is enabled

distinguished by their colour, as black, red, white, or chequered; &amp;c.</p>

<p>CANCELLED TICKET. One rendered useless by some subsequent
arrangement or clerk's error. In either case the word "cancelled" is

enters about the 21st of June, and commences the summer solstice.</p>

<p>CANDLE-BARK. A cylindrical tin box for candles.</p>

<p>CANE. The rattan (<i>Calamus rudentum</i>), is extensively used in the East
for rigging, rope, and cables. The latter have remained for years at
the bottom of the sea uninjured by teredo, or any destructive crustacea.
The cables, too, resist any but the sharpest axes, when used to
connect logs as booms, to stop the navigation of rivers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>CANEVAS. The old word for hempen canvas; but many races, even
the Chinese, make sails entirely of cane. The Americans frequently
use cotton, and term that cloth duck. In the islands of the South
Pacific it is made from the bark of various trees, grasses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>CAN-HOOKS. They are used to sling a cask by the chimes, or ends
of its staves, and are formed by reeving the two ends of a piece of rope

board or on shore, and made either of brass or iron. The principal
parts are:&mdash;1st. The breech, together with the cascable and its button,
called by seamen the pommelion. The breech is of solid metal, from the
bottom of the concave cylinder or chamber to the cascable. 2d. The
trunnions, which project on each side, and serve to support the
cannon, hold it almost in equilibrio. 3d. The bore or caliber, is the
interior of the cylinder, wherein the powder and shot are lodged when
the cannon is loaded. The entrance of the bore is called the mouth
or muzzle. It may be generally described as gradually tapering, with
the various modifications of first and second reinforce and swell, to the
muzzle or forward end. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#GUN">Gun</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a name="CANOE" id="CANOE"></a>CANOE. A peculiar boat used by several uncivilized nations, formed
of the trunk of a tree hollowed out, and sometimes of several pieces
of bark joined together, and again of hide. They are of various sizes,
according to the uses for which they are designed, or the countries to
which they belong. Some carry sail, but they are commonly rowed
with paddles, somewhat resembling a corn-shovel; and instead of
rowing with it horizontally, as with an oar, they manage it perpendicularly.
In Greenland and Hudson Bay, the Esquimaux limits of
America, skin-boats are chiefly in use, under the name of kaiack,
oomiak, baidar, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<p>CANOPUS. The lucida of Argo Navis, and a Greenwich star. Also,
a city of classical importance, visited by the heroes of the Trojan war,
the reputed burial-place of the pilot of Menelaus, &amp;c. But, as some
ancient places have been so fortunate as to renew their classical importance
in modern times, so this, under the modern name of Abukeir, has
received a new "stamp of fate," by its overlooking, like Salamis, the
scene of a naval battle, which also led to a decision of the fate of
nations. In this bay Nelson, at one blow, destroyed the fleet of the
enemy, and cut off the veteran army of France from the shores of
Egypt. The Canopian mouth of the Nile was the most westerly of all
the branches of that celebrated river.</p>

<p>CANOPY. A light awning over the stern-sheets of a boat.</p>

<p>CANT-SPAR. A hand-mast pole, fit for making small masts or yards,
booms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>CANT-TIMBERS. They derive their name from being canted or
raised obliquely from the keel. The upper ends of those on the bow
are inclined to the stem, as those in the after-part incline to the stern-post
above. In a word, cant-timbers are those which do not stand
square with the middle line of the ship. They may be deemed radial
bow or stern-timbers.</p>

<p>CANVAS [from <i>cannabis</i>, hemp]. A cloth made of hemp, and used for
the sails of ships. It is purchased in bolts, and numbered from 1 to 8,
rarely to 9 and 10. Number 1 being the coarsest and strongest, is
used for the lower sails, as fore-sail and main-sail in large ships. When
a vessel is in motion by means of her sails she is said to be under
canvas.</p>

<p>CANVAS-BACK DUCK. An American wild duck (<i>Fuligula valisneria</i>),
which takes this name from the colour of the back feathers; much
esteemed as a delicacy.</p>

<p>CANVAS-CLIMBER. A word used by Marston for a sailor who goes
aloft; hence Marina tells Leonine&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;">
<span class="i0">"And, clasping to a mast, endur'd a sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That almost burst the deck, and from the ladder-tackle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wash'd off a canvas-climber."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>CAP. A strong thick block of wood having two large holes through it,
the one square, the other round, used to confine two masts together,
when one is erected at the head of the other, in order to lengthen it.
The principal caps of a ship are those of the lower masts, which are
fitted with a strong eye-bolt on each side, wherein to hook the block
by which the top-mast is drawn up through the cap. In the same
manner as the top mast slides up through the cap of the lower mast,
the topgallant-mast slides up through the cap of the top-masts. When
made of iron the cap used to be called a crance.&mdash;<i>To cap</i> a mast-head
is placing tarpaulin guards against weather. The term is applied to
any covering such as lead put over iron bolts to prevent corrosion by
sea-water, canvas covers over the ends of rigging, &amp;c. &amp;c. Also, pieces
of oak laid on the upper blocks on which a vessel is built, to receive
the keel. They are split out for the addition of the false keel, and
therefore should be of the most free-grained timber. Also, the coating
which guards the top of a quill tube. Also, the percussion priming
for fire-arms.&mdash;<i>Cap-a-pied</i>, armed from head to foot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>CAP, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To puzzle or beat in argument. To salute by touching the
head-covering, as Shakspeare makes Iago's friends act to Othello. It

<p>CAPACITY. Burden, tonnage, fitness for the service, rating.</p>

<p>CAPE. A projecting point of land jutting out from the coast-line; the
extremity of a promontory, of which last it is the secondary rank. It
differs from a headland, since a cape may be low. The Cape of Good
Hope is always familiarly known as "The Cape." <i>Cape</i> was also used
for a rhumb-line.</p>

<p>CAPE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To keep a course. How does she cape? how does she lie
her course?</p>

<p><a name="CAPE_FLY-AWAY" id="CAPE_FLY-AWAY"></a>CAPE FLY-AWAY. A cloud-bank on the horizon, mistaken for land,

it is closed by forelocks.</p>

<p><a name="CAPSTAN" id="CAPSTAN"></a>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">Cabestan, Capstern, Capston</span>, &amp;c. A mechanical arrangement
for lifting great weights. There is a variety of capsterns, but
they agree in having a horizontal circular head, which has square
holes around its edge, and in these long bars are shipped, and are said
to be "swifted" when their outer ends are traced together; beneath is
a perpendicular barrel, round which is wrapped the rope or chain used
to lift the anchor or other great weight, even to the heaving a ship off
a shoal. Now, in most ships where a capstern is used to lift the
anchor, the chain cable is itself brought to the capstern. The purchase
or lifting power is gained by the great sweep of the bars. A
perpendicular iron spindle passes through the whole capstern, and is
stepped into a socket on the deck below the one on which it stands.
In some cases capsterns are double in height, so that bars may be
worked on two decks, giving more room for the men.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">To come up the</span>. In one sense is to lift the pauls and
walk back, or turn the capstan the contrary way, thereby slackening,
or letting out some of the rope on which they have been heaving. The
sudden order would be obeyed by surging, or letting go any rope on
which they were heaving. Synonymous to "Come up the purchase."</p>

<p>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">To heave at the</span>. To urge it round, by pushing against
the bars, as already described.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">To man the</span>. To place the sailors at it in readiness to
heave.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">To paul the</span>. To drop all the pauls into their sockets, to
prevent the capstan from recoiling during any pause of heaving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">To rig the</span>. To fix the bars in their respective holes,
thrust in the pins to confine them, and reeve the swifter through the
ends.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN, <span class="sm1">Surge the</span>. Is the order to slacken the rope which is
wound round the barrel while heaving, to prevent it from riding or
fouling. This term specially applies to surging the messenger when it
rides, or when the two lashing eyes foul on the whelps or the barrel.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN-BAR PINS. Pins inserted through their ends to prevent
their unshipping.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN-BARRING. An obsolete sea-punishment, in which the
offender was sentenced to carry a capstan-bar during a watch.</p>

<p><a name="CAPSTAN-BARS" id="CAPSTAN-BARS"></a>CAPSTAN-BARS. Long pieces of wood of the best ash or hickory,
one end of which is thrust into the square holes in the drumhead,
like the spokes of a wheel. They are used to heave the capstan
round, by the men setting their hands and chests against them, and
walking round. They are also held in their places in the drumhead
holes, by little iron bolts called capstan or safety pins, to prevent
their flying out when the surging overcomes the force of the men.
Many men have been killed by this action, and more by the omission
to "pin and swift."</p>

<p>CAPSTAN-ROOM. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#ROOM">Room</a></span>.</p>

<p>CAPSTAN-STEP. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#STEP_OF_THE_CAPSTAN">Step of the Capstan</a></span>.) The men march
round to the tune of a fiddle or fife, and the phrase of excitement is,
"Step out, lads, make your feet tell."</p>

<p>CAPSTAN-SWIFTER. A rope passed horizontally through notches in
the outer ends of the bars, and drawn very tight: the intent is to
steady the men as they walk round when the ship rolls, and to give
room for a greater number to assist, by manning the swifters both
within and without.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN. This title is said to be derived from the eastern military
magistrate <i>katapan</i>, meaning "over everything;" but the term <i>capitano</i>
was in use among the Italians nearly 200 years before Basilius II.
appointed his katapan of Apulia and Calabria, <span class="sm2">A.D.</span> 984. Hence, the
corruption of the Apulian province into <i>capitanata</i>. Among the
Anglo-Saxons the captain was <i>schipp-hl&aacute;ford</i>, or ship's lord. The
captain, strictly speaking, is the officer commanding a line-of-battle
ship, or a frigate carrying twenty or more cannon. A captain in the
royal navy is answerable for any bad conduct in the military government,
navigation, and equipment of his ship; also for any neglect of
duty in his inferior officers, whose several charges he is appointed to
regulate. It is also a title, though incorrectly, given to the masters of
all vessels whatever, they having no commissions. It is also applied in
the navy itself to the chief sailor of particular gangs of men; in rank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
captain of the forecastle, admiral's coxswain, captain's coxswain,
captain of the hold, captain of main-top, captain of fore-top, &amp;c.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN. A name given to the crooner, crowner, or gray gurnard
(<i>Trigla gurnardus</i>).</p>

<p>CAPTAIN <span class="sm1">of a Merchant Ship</span>. Is a certificated officer in the
mercantile marine, intrusted with the entire charge of a ship, both as
regards life and property. He is in no way invested with special
powers to meet his peculiar circumstances, but has chiefly to depend
upon moral influence for maintaining order amongst his passengers and
crew during the many weeks or even months that he is cut off from
appeal to the laws of his country, only resorting to force on extreme
occasions. Great tact and judgment is required to fulfil this duty
properly.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN <span class="sm1">of a Ship of War</span>. Is the commanding officer; as well
the post-captain (a title now disused) as those whose proper title is
commander.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN <span class="sm1">of the Fleet</span>. Is a temporary admiralty appointment;
he is entitled to be considered as a flag-officer, and to a share
in the prize-money accordingly. He carries out all orders issued by
the commander-in-chief, but his special duty is to keep up the discipline
of the fleet, in which he is supreme. He is the adjutant-general of
the force, hoisting the flag and wearing the uniform of rear-admiral.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN <span class="sm1">of the Head</span>. Not a recognized rating, but an ordinary
man appointed to attend to the swabs, and to keep the ship's head
clean.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN <span class="sm1">of the Hold</span>. The last of the captains in rank, as a first-class
petty officer.</p>

<p><a name="CAPTAIN_of_the_Port" id="CAPTAIN_of_the_Port"></a>CAPTAIN <span class="sm1">of the Port</span>. The captain of the port is probably better
explained by referring to that situation at Gibraltar. He belongs to
the Board of Health; he controls the entries and departures, the
berthing at the anchorage, and general marine duties, but possesses no
naval authority. Hence, the port-captain is quite another officer.
(<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#Port-captain">Port-captain</a></span>.)</p>

<p>CAPTAIN-GENERAL. The highest army rank.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN'S CLERK. One whose duty is strictly to keep all books
and official papers necessary for passing the captain's accounts at the

consists of two thick planks (called brackets or cheeks) laid on edge to
support the trunnions, and resting, besides other transverse connections,
on two axle-trees, which are borne on low solid wooden wheels called
trucks, or sometimes, to diminish the recoil, on flat blocks called
chocks. The hind axle-tree takes, with the intervention of various
elevating arrangements, the preponderance of the breech. The second
kind is adapted for field and siege work: the shallow brackets are
raised in front on high wheels, but unite behind into a solid beam
called the trail, which tapers downwards, and rests on the ground
when in action, but for travel is connected to a two-wheeled carriage
called a <i><a href="#LIMBER">limber</a></i> (which see). Gun-carriages are chiefly made of elm
for ship-board, as less given to splinter from shot, and of oak on shore;

firing signals, as the officer who commands her is particularly ordered
to carry no cargo, ammunition, or implements of war. Cartel also
signifies an agreement between two hostile powers for a mutual exchange

of most breech-loaders, the percussion priming also; in the case of
some very light pieces the shot is included, and then named a round
of "fixed ammunition;" and for breech-loading guns some sort of
lubricator is generally inclosed in the forward end of the cartridge.</p>

<p>CATAMARAN. A sort of raft used in the East Indies, Brazils, and
elsewhere: those of the island of Ceylon, like those of Madras and
other parts of that coast, are formed of three logs; the timber preferred
for their construction is the <i>D&uacute;p</i> wood, or <i>Cherne-Maram</i>, the
pine varnish-tree. Their length is from 20 to 25 feet, and breadth
2<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> to 3<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> feet, secured together by means of three spreaders and cross
lashings, through small holes; the centre log is much the largest, with
a curved surface at the fore-end, which tends and finishes upwards to
a point. The side logs are very similar in form, and fitted to the
centre log. These floats are navigated with great skill by one or two
men, in a kneeling position; they think nothing of passing through
the surf which lashes the beach at Madras and at other parts of these
coasts, when even the boats of the country could not live upon the
waves; they are also propelled out to the shipping at anchor when
boats of the best construction and form would be swamped. In the
monsoons, when a sail can be got on them, a small out-rigger is placed
at the end of two poles, as a balance, with a bamboo mast and yard,
and a mat or cotton-cloth sail, all three parts of which are connected;
and when the tack and sheet of the sail are let go, it all falls fore and
aft alongside, and being light, is easily managed. In carrying a press
of sail, they are trimmed by the balance-lever, by going out on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>

ease and safety of the mast.</p>

<p>CAT-HEAD. The cat-head passes through the bow-bulwark obliquely
forward on a radial line from the fore-mast, rests on the timbers even
with the water-way, passes through the deck, and is secured to the
side-timbers. It is selected from curved timber. Its upper head is
on a level with the upper rail; it is furnished with three great sheaves,
and externally strengthened by a cat-head knee. It not only is used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to lift the anchor from the surface of the water, but as it "looks forward,"
the cat-block is frequently lashed to the cable to aid by its
powerful purchase when the capstan fails to make an impression. The
cat-fall rove through the sheaves, and the cat-block furnish the cat-purchase.
The cat-head thus serves to suspend the anchor clear of the
bow, when it is necessary to let it go: the knee by which it is supported
is generally ornamented with carving. Termed also <i>cat-head bracket</i>.</p>

<p>CAT-HOLES. Places or spaces made in the quarter, for carrying out
fasts or springs for steadying or heaving astern.</p>

this the seamen who transgress are flogged upon the bare back.</p>

<p>CATRAIA. The catraia of Lisbon and Oporto, or pilot surf-boats, are
about 56 feet long, by 15 feet beam, impelled by sixteen oars.</p>

<p>CAT-RIG. A rig which in smooth water surpasses every other, but,
being utterly unsuited for sea or heavy weather, is only applicable to
pleasure-boats who can choose their weather. It allows one sail only&mdash;an
enormous fore-and-aft main-sail, spread by a gaff at the head and
a boom at the foot, hoisted on a stout mast, which is stepped close to
the stem.</p>

<p>CAT-ROPE. A line for hauling the cat-hook about: also cat-back-rope,
which hauls the block to the ring of the anchor in order to hook it.</p>

<p>CAT'S-PAW. A light air perceived at a distance in a calm, by the
impressions made on the surface of the sea, which it sweeps very
gently, and then passes away, being equally partial and transitory.
Old superstitious seamen are seen to scratch the backstays with their
nails, and whistle to invoke even these cat's-paws, the general forerunner
of the steadier breeze. Cat's-paw is also a name given to a
particular twisting hitch, made in the bight of a rope, so as to induce
two small bights, in order to hook a tackle on them both. Also, good-looking
seamen employed to entice volunteers.</p>

<p>CAT'S-SKIN. A light partial current of air, as with the cat's-paw.</p>

<p>CAT'S-TAIL. The inner part of the cat-head, that fays down upon the

<p>CAT-TACKLE. A strong tackle, used to draw the anchor perpendicularly
up to the cat-head, which latter is sometimes called cat.</p>

<p>CATTAN. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#KATAN">Katan</a></span>.</p>

<p>CAT THE ANCHOR. When the cat is hooked and "cable enough" veered
and stoppered, the anchor hangs below the cat-head, swings beneath it;
it is then hauled close up to the cat-head by the purchase called the
cat-fall. The cat-stopper is then passed, and the cat-block unhooked.</p>

<p>CATTING. The act of heaving the anchor by the cat-tackle. Also,
sea-sickness.</p>

<p><a name="CATTY" id="CATTY"></a>CATTY. A Chinese commercial weight of 18 ozs. English. Tea is

untwisted and drawn asunder, into the seams of the planks, or into
the intervals where the planks are joined together in the ship's decks
or sides, or rends in the planks, in order to prevent the entrance of
water. After the oakum is driven in very hard, hot melted pitch or
rosin is poured into the groove, to keep the water from rotting it.
Among the ancients the first who made use of pitch in caulking were
the inhabitants of Ph&aelig;acia, afterwards called Corfu. Wax and rosin
appear to have been commonly used before that period; and the
Poles still substitute an unctuous clay for the same purpose for the

to shrink on wet ground and give way. The chain measure is 66 feet.</p>

<p>CHAINAGE OF SHIP. An old right of the admiral.</p>

<p>CHAIN-BOLT. A large bolt to secure the chains of the dead-eyes

superseded hemp cables in recent times; they are divided into parts
15 fathoms in length, which are connected by shackles, any one of

ship's sides under the channels, and to these plates the dead-eyes are
fastened; other plates lap over and secure them below. Formerly, and
still in great ships, the dead-eyes were linked to chain-pieces, and from
their being occasionally made in one plate they have obtained this
appellation.</p>

<p><a name="CHAIN-PUMP" id="CHAIN-PUMP"></a>CHAIN-PUMP. This is composed of two long metal tubes let down
through the decks somewhat apart from each other, but joined at their
lower ends, which are pierced with holes for the admission of water.
Above the upper part of the tubes is a sprocket-wheel worked by crank
handles; over this wheel, and passing through both tubes, is an endless
chain, furnished at certain distances with bucket valves or pistons,
turning round a friction-roller. The whole, when set in motion by
means of the crank handles, passing down one tube and up the other,
raises the water very rapidly.</p>

<p><a name="CHAINS" id="CHAINS"></a>CHAINS, properly <span class="sm1">Chain-wales</span>, or <span class="sm1">Channels</span>. Broad and thick
planks projecting horizontally from the ship's outside, to which they
are fayed and bolted, abreast of and somewhat behind the masts. They
are formed to project the chain-plate, and give the lower rigging greater
out-rig or spread, free from the top-sides of the ship, thus affording
greater security and support to the masts, as well as to prevent the
shrouds from damaging the gunwale, or being hurt by rubbing against
it. Of course they are respectively designated fore, main, and mizen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
They are now discontinued in many ships, the eyes being secured to
the timber-heads, and frequently within the gunwale to the stringers

the leadsman who stands on the channels between two shrouds to
heave the hand-lead.</p>

<p>CHAIN-SHOT. Two balls connected either by a bar or chain, for

<p>CHAMBER OF A PIECE OF ORDNANCE. The end of the bore
modified to receive the charge of powder. In mortars, howitzers, and
shell-guns, they are of smaller diameter than the bore, for the charges
being comparatively small, more effect is thus expected. The <a href="#GOMER">gomer
chamber</a> (which see) is generally adopted in our service. In rifled
guns the powder-chamber is not rifled; it and the bullet-chamber differ
in other minute respects from the rest of the bore. Patereroes for
festive occasions are sometimes called chambers; as the small mortars,
formerly used for firing salutes in the parks, termed also pint-pots
from their shape and handles.</p>

gun is loaded for execution. The rules for loading large ordnance are:
that the piece be first cleaned or scoured inside; that the proper quantity
of powder be next driven in and rammed down, care however

vessel, the names of the master and freighters, the place and time of
lading and unlading, and stipulations as to demurrage. The charter-party
is dissolved by a complete embargo, though not by the temporary
stopping of a port. It is thus colloquially termed a pair of indentures.</p>

<p>CHASE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To pursue a ship, which is also called giving chase.&mdash;<i>A
stern chase</i> is when the chaser follows the chased astern, directly upon
the same point of the compass.&mdash;<i>To lie with a ship's fore-foot in a

which she is said to have a good forward or good stern chase. Chasing
to windward, is often termed chasing in the wind's eye.</p>

outer end is "bent" by the clinch to the ring of the anchor. The
inner or tier-clinch in the good old times was clinched to the main-mast,
passing under the tier beams (where it was unlawfully, as regards
the custom of the navy, clinched). Thus "the cable runs out to the
clinch," means, there is no more to veer.&mdash;<i>To clinch</i> is to batter or

irons, or span-shackles were substituted, called <i>Spanish clues</i>, formed
by fixing the knittles at equal distances upon a piece of rope instead

employed about the sails are coiled upon cleats at sea, to prevent their
being entangled.</p>

<p><a name="COIR" id="COIR"></a>COIR. Cordage made from the fibrous husks of the cocoa-nut; though
cables made of it are disagreeable to handle and coil away, they have
the advantage of floating in water, so that vessels ride easily by them;
they are still used by the Calcutta pilot-brigs. True coir is from the
<i>Borassus gomutus</i>, the long fibrous black cloth-like covering of the
stem. It is from this that the black cables in the East are made; the
cocoa-nut fibre being of a reddish hue. It is used for strong brushes,

war of under twenty guns, a sloop of war, armed ship, or bomb-vessel.
He was entitled master and commander, and ranked with a major
of the army: now simply termed commander, and ranking with

is binding upon the interests of all under him, and he is alone
responsible for costs and damages: he may act erroneously, and abandon
what might have turned out good prize to himself and crew.&mdash;<i>Commander</i>
is also the name of a large wooden mallet used specially in
the sail and rigging lofts, as anything of metal would injure the ropes

crown appoints five or seven commissioners for executing the office of
lord high-admiral, &amp;c.; for this important and high office has seldom
been intrusted to any single person. The admiralty jurisdiction
extends to all offences mentioned in the articles of war, or new naval
code, as regards places beyond the powers of the law courts, or outside
the bounds of a county. But all criminal acts committed within the
limits of a county, or within a line drawn from one headland to the
next, are specially liable to be tried by the common law courts. The
high court of admiralty civil court takes cognizance of salvage, prize-derelict,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>

the customs department of the public revenue.</p>

<p>COMMISSIONERS OF THE NAVY. Certain officers formerly
appointed to superintend the affairs of the navy, under the direction of
the lords-commissioners of the Admiralty. Their duty was more immediately
concerned in the building, docking, and repairing of ships
in the dockyards; they had also the appointment of some of the
officers, as surgeons, masters, &amp;c., and the transport, victualling, and
medical departments were controlled by that board. It was abolished
in 1831.</p>

<p>COMMIT ONE'S SELF, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To break through regulations. To
incur responsibility without regard to results.</p>

<p>COMMODORE. A senior officer in command of a detached squadron.
A captain finding five or six ships assembled, was formerly permitted
to hoist his pennant, and command as commodore; and a necessity
arising for holding a court-martial, he ordered the said court to
assemble. Again, where an admiral dies in command, the senior captain
hoists a first-class broad pennant, and appoints a captain, secretary,
and flag-lieutenant, fulfils the duties of a rear-admiral, and wears
the uniform. Commodores of the second class have no captain or pennant-lieutenant.
A commodore rates with brigadier-generals, according
to dates of commission (being of full colonel's rank). He is next
in command to a rear-admiral, but cannot hoist his broad pennant in
the presence of an admiral, or superior captain, without permission.
The broad pennant is a swallow-tailed tapered burgee. The second-class
commodore is to hoist his broad pennant, white at the fore. It
is a title given by courtesy to the senior captain, where three or more
ships of war are cruising in company. It was also imported into the
East India Company's vessels, the senior being so termed, <i>inter se</i>. It
moreover denotes the convoy ship, which carries a light in her top.
The epithet is corrupted from the Spanish <i>comendador</i>.</p>

round-house, through which light passes to the cabins and decks
below; and a sort of wooden hood placed over the entrance or staircase
of the master's cabin in small ships. Flush-decked vessels are
generally fitted with movable companions, to keep the rain or water
from descending, which are unshipped when the capstan is required.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>COMPANION-LADDER. Denotes the ladder by which the officers

<p>COMPARISON WATCH. The job-watch for taking an observation,
compared before and after with the chronometer.</p>

<p>COMPARTMENT BULK-HEADS. Some of the iron ships have
adopted the admirable Chinese plan of dividing the hold athwart-ship
by strong water-tight bulk-heads, into compartments, so that a leak in
any one of them does not communicate with the others&mdash;thus strengthening
a vessel, besides adding to its security. Compartment bulk-heads
were first directed to be fitted under the superintendence of
Commander Belcher in H.M. ships <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> at Chatham,
for Arctic service in 1835. H.M.S. <i>Terror</i>, Commander Back, was
saved entirely owing to this fitment, the after section being full of
water all the passage home; and lately the mail packet <i>Samphire</i> was
similarly saved.</p>

<p><a name="COMPASANT" id="COMPASANT"></a>COMPASANT. A corruption of <i>corpo santo</i>, a ball of electric light
observed flickering about the masts, yard-arms, and rigging, during
heavy rain, thunder, and lightning.</p>

<p><a name="COMPASS" id="COMPASS"></a>COMPASS. An instrument employed by navigators to guide the ship's
course at sea. It consists of a circular box, containing a fly or paper
card, which represents the horizon, and is suspended by two concentric
rings called gimbals. The fly is divided into thirty-two equal parts,
by lines drawn from the centre to the circumference, called points or
rhumbs; the interval between the points is subdivided into 360 degrees&mdash;consequently,
the distance or angle comprehended between any
two rhumbs is equal to 11 degrees and 15 minutes. The four cardinal
points lie opposite to each other; the north and south points form top
and bottom, leaving the east on the right hand, and the west on the
left; the names of all the inferior points are compounded of these
according to their situation. This card is attached to a magnetic
needle, which, carrying the card round with it, points north, excepting
for the local annual variation and the deviation caused by the iron in
the ship; the angle which the course makes with that meridian is
shown by the lubber's point, a dark line inside the box. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#ADJUSTMENT_OF_THE_COMPASS">Adjustment
of the Compass</a></span>.)</p>

without any apparent external defect. One man threatening
to complain of another, is saying that he will report misconduct to the
officer in charge of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>COMPLEMENT. The proper number of men employed in any ship,

<p><a name="CONN" id="CONN"></a>CONN, <span class="sm1">Con, or Cun</span>, as pronounced by seamen. This word is derived
from the Anglo-Saxon <i>conne</i>, <i>connan</i>, to know, or be skilful. The
pilot of old was skillful, and later the master was selected to conn the
ship in action, that is, direct the helmsman. The quarter-master

wait on consuls, but vice-consuls wait on commanders (<i>in Etiquette</i>).
Ministers and <i>charg&eacute;s d'affaires</i> retire in case of hostilities, but consuls
are permitted to remain to watch the interests of their countrymen.
When commerce began to flourish in modern Europe, occasion soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
arose for the institution of a kind of court-merchant, to determine
commercial affairs in a summary way. Their authority depends very
much on their commission, and on the words of the treaty on which
it is founded. The consuls are to take care of the affairs of the trade,
and of the rights, interests, and privileges of their countrymen in foreign
ports. Not being public ministers, they are liable to the <i>lex loci</i> both
civil and criminal, and their exemption from certain taxes depends upon
treaty and custom.</p>

all custom-house duties being paid up, and see that they be not
prohibited by parliament or public proclamation. Contraband is simply
defined, "merchandise forbidden by the law of nations to be supplied to
an enemy;" but it affords fat dodges to the admiralty court sharks.</p>

The cook, <i>par excellence</i>, in the navy, was a man of importance, responsible
for the proper cooking of the food, yet not overboiling the meat to
extract the fat&mdash;his perquisite. The coppers were closely inspected
daily by the captain, and if they soiled a cambric handkerchief the cook's
allowance was stopped. Now, the ship's cook is a first-class petty officer,
and cannot be punished as heretofore. In a merchantman the cook is,
<i>ex officio</i>, the hero of the fore-sheet, as the steward is of the main one.</p>

&amp;c.&mdash;<i>Counter of a ship</i>, refers to her after-seat on the water: the
counter above extends from the gun-deck line, or lower ribbon moulding
of the cabin windows, to the water-line (or seat of water); the lower
counter is arched below that line, and constitutes the hollow run. It is
formed on the transom-buttocks.</p>

<p><a name="COUNTER-APPROACHES" id="COUNTER-APPROACHES"></a>COUNTER-APPROACHES. Works effected outside the place by the
garrison during a siege, to enfilade, command, or otherwise check the
approaches of the besieger.</p>

<p>COUNTER-BALANCE WEIGHT, in the marine engine. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#LEVER">Lever</a></span>.)
Also in many marine barometers, where it slides and is fixed by adjusting
screws, so as to produce an even-balanced swing, free from jerk.</p>

<p><a name="COUNTER-BRACE" id="COUNTER-BRACE"></a>COUNTER-BRACE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. Is bracing the head-yards one way, and the
after-yards another. The counter-brace is the lee-brace of the fore-topsail-yard,
but is only distinguished by this name at the time of the
ship's going about (called tacking), when the sail begins to shiver in the
wind, this brace is hauled in to flatten the sail against the lee-side of the
top-mast, and increase the effect of the wind in forcing her round.
Counter-bracing becomes necessary to render the vessel stationary when
sounding, lowering a boat, or speaking a stranger. It is now an obsolete
term, and the man&#339;uvre is called <i>heaving-to</i>.</p>

<p>COUNTER-CURRENT. That portion of water diverted from the main
stream of a current by the particular formation of the coast or other obstruction,
and which therefore runs in a contrary direction. There is
also a current formed under the lee-counter of a ship when going through
the water, which retains floating objects there, and is fatal to a man, by
sucking him under.</p>

<p><a name="COUNTERFORTS" id="COUNTERFORTS"></a>COUNTERFORTS. Masonry adjuncts, advantageous to all retaining
walls, but especially to those which, like the escarps of fortresses, are
liable to be battered. They are attached at regular intervals to the
hinder face of the wall, and perpendicular to it; having various proportions,
but generally the same height as the wall; they hold it from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
thrust forward from behind, and, even when it is battered away, retain
the earth at the back at such a steep slope that the formation of a practicable
breach remains very difficult. When arches are turned between
the counterforts, the strength of the whole structure is much increased:
it is then called a <i>counter-arched rev&ecirc;tement</i>.</p>

<p>COUNTERGUARD. In fortification, a smaller rampart raised in front
of a larger one, principally with the intention of delaying for a period
the besieger's attack. Other means, however, are generally preferred in
modern times, except when a rapid fall in the ground renders it difficult
to cover the main escarp by ordinary resources.</p>

<p>COUNTER-LINE. A word often used for <i>contravallation</i>.</p>

<p>COUNTERMARCH. To change the direction of a march to its exact
opposite. In some military movements this involves the changing of
front and wings.</p>

<p>COUNTERMINES. Military defensive mines: they may be arranged on
a system for the protection of the whole of a front of fortification by the
discovering and blowing up not only the subterranean approaches of the
besieger, but also his more important lodgments above.</p>

<p>COUNTER-MOULD. The converse of <i><a href="#MOULDS">mould</a></i> (which see).</p>

<p>COUNTER-RAILS. The balustrade work, or ornamental moulding across
a square stern, where the counter terminates.</p>

<p>COUNTERSCARP. In fortification, the outer side of the ditch next the
country; it is usually of less height, and less strongly revetted than the
escarp, the side which forms the face of the rampart.</p>

<p>COUNTER-SEA. The disturbed state of the sea after a gale, when, the
wind having changed, the sea still runs in its old direction.</p>

<p>COUNTERSIGN. A particular word or number which is exchanged

nails to be sunk in, so as to be even with the general surface.</p>

of the compass <i>towards</i> which they run, as water in a river, tides, and currents;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but of the wind, as similarly indicated by the compass-point <i>from</i>
which it blows. Course is also the ship's way. In common parlance,
it is the point of the compass upon which the ship sails, the direction in
which she proceeds, or is intended to go. When the wind is foul, she
cannot "lie her course;" if free, she "steers her course."</p>

<p>COURSES. A name by which the sails hanging from the lower yards of
a ship are usually distinguished, viz. the main-sail, fore-sail, and mizen:
the staysails upon the lower masts are sometimes also comprehended in
this denomination, as are the main staysails of all brigs and schooners.
A ship is under her courses when she has no sail set but the fore-sail,
main-sail, and mizen. <i><a href="#TRYSAIL">Trysails</a></i> are courses (which see), sometimes termed
<i>bentincks</i>.</p>

<p>COURSET. The paper on which the night's course is set for the officer in
charge of the watch.</p>

<p>COURT-MARTIAL. A tribunal held under an act of parliament, of the
year 1749, and not, like the mutiny act, requiring yearly re-enactment.
It has lately, 6th August, 1861, been changed to the "Naval Discipline
Act." At present a court may be composed of five, but must not exceed
nine, members. No officer shall sit who is under twenty-one years of
age. No flag-officer can be tried unless the president also be a flag-officer,
and the others flag, or captains. No captain shall be tried unless the
president be of higher rank, and the others captains and commanders.
No court for the trial of any officer, or person below the rank of captain,
shall be legal, unless the president is a captain, or of higher rank, nor
unless, in addition, there be two other officers of the rank of commander,
or of higher rank. Any witness summoned&mdash;civil, naval, or
military&mdash;by the judge-advocate, refusing to attend or give evidence, to
be punished as for same in civil courts. The admiralty can issue commissions
to officers to hold courts-martial on foreign stations, without which
they cannot be convened. A commander-in-chief on a foreign station,
holding such a commission, may under his hand authorize an officer in
command of a detached portion to hold courts-martial. Formerly all
officers composing the court, attendants, witnesses, &amp;c., were compelled to
appear in their full-dress uniforms; but by recent orders, the undress
uniform, with cocked hat and sword, is to be worn.</p>

<p>COVER. Security from attack or interruption, as under cover of the ship's
guns, under cover of the parapet. In the field exercise and drill of
troops, one body is said to cover another exactly in rear of it. Covers
for sails when furled (to protect them from the weather when loosing and
airing them is precluded), are made of strong canvas painted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="COVERED_WAY" id="COVERED_WAY"></a>COVERED WAY. In fortification, a space running along the outside of
the ditch for the convenient passage of troops and guns, covered from the
country by a palisading and the parapet of the glacis. It is of importance
to an active defence, as besides enabling a powerful musketry fire to be
poured on the near approaches of the besieger, it affords to the garrison
a secure base from which to sally in force at any hour of the day or night.</p>

to a cross, with four quarters of a shot at its radial points. It was used
to destroy the rigging as well as do execution amongst men.</p>

<p>CROSS-SEA. A sea not caused by the wind then blowing. During a
heavy gale which changes quickly (a cyclone, for instance), each change
of wind produces a direction of the sea, which lasts for some hours after
the wind which caused it has changed, so that in a part of the sea which
has experienced all the changes of one of these gales, the sea runs up in
pyramids, sending the tops of the waves perpendicularly into the air,
which are then spread by the prevailing wind; the effect is awfully grand
and dangerous, for it generally renders a ship ungovernable until it abates.</p>

long block, used to suspend the awnings by, or to keep the top-sails from
striking violently, and fretting against the top-rims. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#EUPHROE">Euphroe</a></span>.)
Also, a kind of stand, attached to the end of mess-tables, and hooked to a
beam above.&mdash;<i>Crow-foot</i> or <i>beam-arm</i> is also a crooked timber, extended
from the side of a beam to the ship's side, in the wake of the hatchway,
supplying the place of a beam.&mdash;<i>Crow's-foot</i> is the name of the four-pointed
irons thrown in front of a position, to hamper the advance of
cavalry, and other assailants, for in whatsoever way they fall one point is
upwards. The phrase of <i>crow's-feet</i> is also jocularly applied to the
wrinkles spreading from the outer corner of the eyes&mdash;a joke used both
by Chaucer and Spenser.</p>

<p>CUTTING DOWN. Taking a deck off a ship; as ships of the line are
converted into frigates, the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> into a turret ship, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Cutting
down</i> is also a dangerous midshipman's trick, and sometimes

in another dead-eye on the shroud end, creates a purchase to set up and
extend the shrouds and stays, backstays, &amp;c., of the standing and top-mast
rigging. The term <i>dead</i> seems to have been used because there

from the vessel's side to the top of the rail, where they are connected with
the rigging. The dead-eyes used for the stays have only one hole, which,
however, is large enough to receive ten or twelve turns of the laniard&mdash;these
are generally termed <i>hearts</i>, on account of their shape. The <i>crowfeet
dead-eyes</i> are long cylindrical blocks with a number of small holes in them,

the rounding abaft allowing the fluid soon to recover its state of rest.</p>

<p>DEAD WEIGHT. A vessel's lading when it consists of heavy goods, but
particularly such as pay freight according to their weight and not their
<i>stowage</i>.</p>

<p>DEAD WOOD. Certain blocks of timber, generally oak, fayed on the
upper side of the keel, particularly at the extremities before and abaft,
where these pieces are placed upon each other to a considerable height,

<p class="in3">But latterly, 56 and 84 pounders on the lower, and 32 on the middle,
afforded a heavier weight of broadside. The <i>Santissima Trinidada</i>, taken
from the Spaniards, carried four whole tiers of guns. Now, the tonnage
of the largest of these would be insignificant. "Deckers" are exploded,
and a <i>Pallas</i> of the same tonnage (2372) carries 8 guns, a <i>Bellerophon</i>
(4272) carries 18 guns, ranging in size, however, from the 64-pounder up
to the 300-pounder.&mdash;<i>Flush-deck</i>, or deck flush fore and aft, implies a continued
floor laid from stem to stern, upon one line, without any stops
or intervals.&mdash;<i>Half-deck.</i> In the Northumberland colliers the steerage
itself is called the half-deck, and is usually the habitation of the ship's
crew.</p>

<p>DECK-SEAM. The interstices between the planks.</p>

<p>DECK-SHEET. That sheet of a studding-sail which leads directly to
the deck, by which it is steadied until set; it is also useful in taking it
in, should the down-haul be carried away.</p>

<p><a name="DECK_STANDARD-KNEES" id="DECK_STANDARD-KNEES"></a>DECK STANDARD-KNEES. Iron knees having two tails, the one

while the middle part is bolted to the ship's side.</p>

<p><a name="DECK-STOPPER" id="DECK-STOPPER"></a>DECK-STOPPER. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#STOPPER_of_the_Cable">Stopper of the Cable</a></span>.) A strong stopper used for securing the
cable forward of the capstan or windlass while it is overhauled. Also
abaft the windlass or bitts to prevent more cable from running out.</p>

<p>DECK-TACKLE. A purchase led along the decks.</p>

<p>DECLARATION OF WAR. A ceremonial frequently omitted, and
esteemed by the greatest authorities rather a proof of magnanimity than
a duty. The Romans proclaimed it; but except Achaia, none of the
Grecian states did. It would be to the interests of humanity and courtesy
were it made indispensable. It has been held (especially in the
case of the <i>Leopard</i> and <i>Chesapeake</i>) that without a declaration of war,
no hostile act at the order of an admiral is legal.</p>

<p>DECLINATION, of a celestial object, is the arc between its centre and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>

<p>DECOY. So to change the aspect of a ship-of-war by striking a topgallant-mast,
setting ragged sails, disfiguring the sides by whitewash or
gunpowder, yellow, &amp;c., as to induce a vessel of inferior force to chase;
when, getting within gun-shot range, she becomes an easy capture.
Similar man&#339;uvres are sometimes used by a single ship to induce an
enemy's squadron to follow her into the view of her own fleet.</p>

<p>DEEP. A word figuratively applied to the ocean. On the coast of
Germany, to the northward of Friesland, it is of the same import as
gulf on the coasts of France, Spain, Italy, &amp;c. Also, any depth over 20
fathoms.&mdash;<i>Deep-sea fishing.</i> In contradistinction to coast, or when the
hand-lead reaches bottom at 20 fathoms.&mdash;<i>Hand deeps.</i> Out of ordinary
leadsman's sounding.&mdash;A vessel is deep as regards her lading, and is also
said to sail deep when her expenses run high.</p>

<p>DEEPENING. Running from shoal water by the lead.</p>

<p><a name="DEEP-SEA_LINE" id="DEEP-SEA_LINE"></a>DEEP-SEA LINE. Usually a strong and water-laid line. It is used with

It is marked by knots every ten fathoms, and by a small knot every five.
The marks are now nearly superseded by Massey's patent sounding-machine.&mdash;<i>Marks

<p>DEEP-WAIST. That part of the open skids between the main and fore
drifts in men-of-war. It also relates to the remaining part of a ship's

paid out of commission.</p>

<p>DEFICIENCY. What is wanting of a ship's cargo at the time of delivery.</p>

<p>DEFILADE. In fortification, is the art of so disposing defensive works,
<i>on irregular or commanded sites</i>, that the troops within them shall be
covered from the direct fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>DEFILE. A narrow pass between two heights, which obliges a force
marching through to narrow its front. This may prove disastrous if
attacked, on account of the difficulty of receiving aid from the rear.</p>

<p>DEFILING. Filing off, marching past.</p>

<p>DEFINITIVE. Conclusive; decisive.</p>

<p><a name="DEFLECTION" id="DEFLECTION"></a>DEFLECTION. The tendency of a ship from her true course; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
departure of the magnetic needle from its true bearing, when influenced
by iron or the local attraction of the mass. In artillery, the deviation
of a shot from the direction in which it is fired. The term is usually
reserved to lateral deviations, especially those resulting from irregular
causes&mdash;those constant ones due to the regular motion of rifled projectiles
coming under either of the designations "constant deflection,"
"derivation," borrowed from the French, or "drift," from the Americans.
These latter, according to the direction usually given to the rifling in the
present day, all tend away to the right, though they include some subordinate
curves not yet distinctly determined.</p>

<p>DEFORMED BASTION. One out of shape from the irregularity of its
lines and angles.</p>

<p>DEGRADATION. Debasement and disgrace. The suspension of a petty
officer from his station; and also the depriving an officer or soldier of his

circle, or any circle parallel to it. A degree of latitude is the 90th part
of the quadrant, or quarter of a great meridional circle. Each degree is
divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, according to
the sexagesimal division of the circle. Also, rank or condition.</p>

<p><a name="DEKOYTS" id="DEKOYTS"></a>DEKOYTS, <span class="sm1">or Dacoits</span>. Robbers in India, and also pirates who infested
the rivers between Calcutta and Burhampore, but now suppressed by the
improved system of river police, and the establishment of fast rowing
boats of light draught.</p>

<p>DEL. Saxon for part.&mdash;<i>Del a bit</i>, not a bit, a phrase much altered for the

a fish, so that the barbs hold fast.</p>

<p>DELIVERERS. Particular artificers employed in our early ships of war,
in constructing the castles.</p>

<p>DELL. A narrow valley, ravine, or small dale.</p>

<p>DELTA. A name given by the Greeks to the alluvial tract inclosed between
the bifurcating branches of the Nile and the sea-line. It is well
known that rivers which deposit great quantities of matter, do also very
often separate into two or more branches, previous to their discharge into
the sea; thus forming triangular spaces, aptly called <i>deltas</i> from their
resemblance to the Greek letter &#916;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p class="in1">All deltas appear by their section to be formed of matter totally
different from that of the adjacent country. They are the creation of the
rivers themselves, which, having brought down with their floods vast
quantities of mud and sand from the upper lands, deposit them in the
lowest place, the sea; at whose margin, the current which has hitherto
impelled them ceasing, they are deposited by the mere action of gravity.
This is particularly illustrated on the western coast of Africa by the
shoals off the Rio Grande, Rio Nunez, and others. The coast, as well as
the embouchures of the rivers, exhibit a deposit of deep mud, and yet far
at sea banks of clean siliceous sand arise.</p>

<p>DEMAND. The official paper by which stores are desired for a ship, the
making out of which is the duty of the officer in whose charge the stores
will be placed: they must be approved by the captain and admiral before
being presented to the dockyard authorities. Also, whence from? where
bound?</p>

<p>DEMI-BASTION. In fortification, a bastion which has a flank on one
side only.</p>

<p>DEMI-CANNON. An ancient name for a gun carrying a ball of 33
pounds weight, with a length of from 12 to 14 feet, and a diameter of
bore of 6<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> inches; its point-blank range was estimated at 162 paces, and
its random one at 2000.</p>

<p>DEMI-CULVERIN. An ancient cannon which threw a ball of 9 pounds
weight, was about 9 feet long, and 4 inches in diameter of bore; its
point-blank range was called 174 paces, and its random one about 1800.</p>

<p>DEMIHAG. A long pistol, much used in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>DEMILANCE. A light horseman, who carried a light lance.</p>

<p>DEMILUNE. In fortification, the outwork, more properly called a
<i><a href="#RAVELIN">ravelin</a></i> (which see).</p>

<p>DEMI-REVETMENT. In fortification, that form of retaining wall for
the face of a rampart which is only carried up as high as cover exists in
front of it, leaving above it the remaining height, in the form of an
earthen mound at its natural slope, exposed to, but invulnerable by shot.</p>

<p>DEMONSTRATION-SHIPS. Those kept in a certain state of preparation
for war, though on a peace establishment.</p>

<p>DEMURRAGE. The compensation due to a ship-owner from a freighter
for unduly delaying his vessel in port beyond the time specified in the
charter-party or bill of lading. It is in fact an extended freight. A
ship unjustly detained, as a prize, is entitled to demurrage. Vessels
chartered to convey government stores have a term given for discharge
by government aid. If not delivered within that period, demurrage, as
stated in the document, is paid per diem for any "unavoidable delay."</p>

<p>DEN. A sandy tract near the sea, as at Exmouth and other places.</p>

<p>DEN AND STROND. A liberty for ships or vessels to run or come ashore.

<p>DEPOT. A magazine in which military stores are deposited. Also, a
company left in England for the purpose of recruiting when regiments
are ordered abroad.</p>

<p>DEPRESS. The order to adjust the quoin in great-gun exercise; to
depress the muzzle to point at an object below the level, in contradistinction
to elevate.</p>

<p>DEPRESSED POLE. That end of the earth's axis which is below the
horizon of the spectator according to his being in the northern or southern
hemisphere. Also applied to the stars. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#POLAR_DISTANCE">Polar Distance</a></span>.)</p>

<p>DEPRESSION, <span class="sm1">of the Horizon</span>. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#DIP_of_the_Horizon">Dip</a></span>.) In artillery, the angle
below the horizon at which the axis of a gun is laid in order to strike an
object on a lower level. The depression required in batteries of very
elevated site (those of Gibraltar for example), for the laying the guns on
near vessels, is so great as to necessitate a peculiar carriage.</p>

<p>DEPTH OF A SAIL. The extent of the square sails from the head-rope
to the foot-rope, or the length of the after-leech of a staysail or boom-sail;
in other words, it is the extent of the longest cloth of canvas in any sail.</p>

<p>DEPTH OF HOLD. The height between the floor and the lower-deck;
it is therefore one of the principal dimensions given for the construction
of a ship. It varies, of course, according to the end for which she is
designed, trade or war.</p>

<p><a name="DERELICT" id="DERELICT"></a>DERELICT [Lat. <i>derelictus</i>, abandoned]. Anything abandoned at sea.
A ship is derelict either by consent or by compulsion, stress of weather,
&amp;c., and yet, to save the owner's rights, if any cat, dog, or other domestic
animal be found on board alive, it is not forfeited. The owner may yet
recover, on payment of salvage, within a year and a day&mdash;otherwise the
whole may be awarded. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#SALVAGE">Salvage</a></span>.)</p>

south.</p>

<p>DESCENDING SQUALL. A fitful gust of wind issuing from clouds
which are formed in the lower parts of the atmosphere. It is usually
accompanied with heavy showers, and the weatherwise observe that the
squall is seldom so violent when it is followed as when it is preceded by
rain. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#WHITE_SQUALL">White Squall</a></span> as a forerunner.)</p>

<p>DESCENSION. The same as <i><a href="#OBLIQUE_ASCENSION">oblique ascension</a></i> (which see).</p>

independent of the fall of the former.</p>

<p>DETACHED ESCARP. An escarp wall, originally invented by Carnot,
and revived by the Prussians, removed some distance to the front of the
rampart; which latter, being finished exteriorly at the natural slope of the
earth, remains effective after the destruction of the wall by a besieger.
It was at first intended, being kept low and covered by a near counterguard,
to offer extraordinary difficulties to the besieger's breaching batteries;
but improved artillery has nullified that supposed advantage.</p>

<p>DETACHED WORKS. Works included in the scheme of defence of a
fortress, but separated from it, and beyond the glacis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>DETONATING HAMMER. A modern introduction into the Royal
Navy for firing the guns. With the aid of an attached laniard, it is
made to descend forcibly upon the percussion arm of the tube, and fires
the piece instantaneously. It is, however, already generally superseded

<p><a name="DEVIATION" id="DEVIATION"></a>DEVIATION. A voluntary departure from the usual course of the voyage,
without any necessary or justifiable cause: a step which discharges
the insurers from further responsibility. Liberty to touch, stay, or trade
in any particular place not in the usual course of the voyage must be
expressly specified in the contract, and even this is subordinate to the
voyage. The cases of necessity which justify deviation are&mdash;1, stress of
weather; 2, urgent want of repairs; 3, to join convoy; 4, succouring
ships in distress; 5, avoiding capture or detention; 6, sickness; 7, mutiny
of the crew. It differs from a <i>change</i> of voyage, which must have been
resolved upon before the sailing of the ship. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#CHANGE">Change</a></span>.)&mdash;<i>Deviation</i>
is also the attraction of a ship's iron on the needle. It is a term
recently introduced to distinguish a sort of second variation to be allowed

<p>DEVIL. A sort of priming made by damping and bruising gunpowder.</p>

<p>DEVIL-BOLTS. Those with false clenches, often introduced into contract-built
ships.</p>

<p><a name="DEVIL-FISH" id="DEVIL-FISH"></a>DEVIL-FISH. The <i>Lophius piscatorius</i>, a hideous creature, which has

other appellatives significant of its ugliness and bad manners. There is
also a powerful <i>Raia</i>, which grows to an immense size in the tropics,
known as the devil-fish, the terror of the pearl-divers. <i>Manta</i> of Spaniards.</p>

<p>DEVILRY. Spirited roguery; wanton mischief, short of crime.</p>

<p>DEVIL'S CLAW. A very strong kind of split hook made to grasp a link
of a chain cable, and used as a stopper.</p>

<p>DEVIL'S SMILES. Gleams of sunshine among dark clouds, either in
the heavens or captain's face!</p>

<p>DEVIL'S TABLE-CLOTH. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#TABLE-CLOTH">Table-cloth</a></span>.</p>

<p>DEVIL TO PAY AND NO PITCH HOT. The seam which margins
the water-ways was called the "devil," why only caulkers can tell, who
perhaps found it sometimes difficult for their tools. The phrase, however,
means service expected, and no one ready to perform it. Impatience,
and naught to satisfy it.</p>

<p>DEW-POINT. A meteorological term for the degree of temperature at
which the moisture of the atmosphere would begin to precipitate; it may
be readily ascertained by means of the hygrometer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>DHOLL. A kind of dried split pea supplied in India to the navy.</p>

<p>DHONY, <span class="sm1">or Dhoney</span>. A country trading-craft of India from 50 to 150
tons; mostly flat-bottomed. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#DONEY">Doney</a></span>.)</p>

<p>DHOW. The Arab dhow is a vessel of about 150 to 250 tons burden by
measurement&mdash;grab-built, with ten or twelve ports; about 85 feet long
from stem to stern, 20 feet 9 inches broad, and 11 feet 6 inches deep.
Of late years this description of vessel has been well built at Cochin, on
the Malabar coast, in the European style. They have a great rise of
floor; are calculated for sailing with small cargoes; and are fully prepared,
by internal equipment, for defence&mdash;many of them are sheathed
on 2<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span>-inch plank bottoms, with 1-inch board, and the preparation of
chunam and oil, called <i>galgal</i>, put between; causing the vessel to be very
dry and durable, and preventing the encroachments of the worm or
<i>Teredo navalis</i>. The worm is one of the greatest enemies in India to
timber <i>in</i> the water, as the white ant (<i>termites</i>) is out of it. On the
outside of the sheathing board there is a coat of whitewash, made from
the same materials as that between the sheathing and planks, and renewed
every season they put to sea. They have generally one mast and a lateen
sail. The yard is the length of the vessel aloft, and the mast rakes
forward, for the purpose of keeping this ponderous weight clear in raising
and lowering. The tack of the sail is brought to the stem-head, and
sheets aft in the usual way. The halyards lead to the taffrail, having a
pendant and treble purchase block, which becomes the backstay, to support
the mast when the sail is set. This, with three pairs of shrouds,
completes the rigging, the whole made of <i>coir</i> rope. Several of these
vessels were fitted as brigs, after their arrival in Arabia, and armed by
the Arabs for cruising in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, as piratical
vessels. It was of this class of vessel that Tippoo Sultan's navy at Onore
consisted. The large dhows generally make one voyage in the season,
to the southward of Arabia; taking advantage of the north-east monsoon
to come down, and the south-west to return with an exchange cargo.
The Arabs who man them are a powerful well-grown people, and very
acute and intelligent in trade. They usually navigate their ships to
Bengal in perfect safety, and with great skill. This was well known to
Captain Collier and his officers of the <i>Liverpool</i> frigate, when they had
the trial cruise with the Imam of Muscat's fine frigate in 1820.</p>

<p>DIACLE. An old term for a boat-compass.</p>

<p><a name="DIAGONAL_BRACES" id="DIAGONAL_BRACES"></a>DIAGONAL BRACES, knees, planks, &amp;c., are such as cross a vessel's

of the base-ring at the breech of a gun, and that of the ring at
the swell of the muzzle. On account of the dispart, the line of aim makes
a small angle with the axis; so that the elevation of the latter above the
horizon is greater than that of the line of aim: an allowance for the
dispart is consequently necessary in determining the commencement of
the graduations on the tangent scale, by which the required elevation is
given to the gun.</p>

<p>DISPARTING A GUN. To bring the line of sight and line of metal to
be parallel by setting up a mark on the muzzle-ring of a cannon, so that

is to secure the escarp as long as possible. There are wet ditches and
dry ones, the former being less in favour than the latter, since a dry
ditch so much facilitates sorties, counter-approaches, and the like. That
kind which may be made wet or dry at pleasure is most useful.</p>

<p>DITTY-BAG. Derives its name from the <i>dittis</i> or Manchester stuff of
which it was once made. It is in use among seamen for holding their
smaller necessaries. The ditty-bag of old, when a seaman prided himself
on his rig, as the result of his own ability to fit himself from clue to
earing, was a treasured article, probably worked in exquisite device by
his lady-love. Well can we recollect the pride exhibited in its display
when "on end clothes" was a joyful sound to the old pig-tailed tar.</p>

distinguished by a particular flag, pendant, or vane. A squadron
may be ranged into two or three divisions, the commanding officer of
which is always stationed in the centre. In a fleet the admiral divides it
into three squadrons, each of which is commanded by an admiral, and is
again divided into divisions; each squadron had its proper colours (now
distinguishing mark) according to the rank of the admiral who commanded
it, and each division its proper mast. The private ships carried
pendants of the same colour with their respective squadrons at the masts
of their particular divisions, so that the ships in the last division of the
blue squadron carried a blue pendant at their main topgallant-mast
head, the vane at the mizen. All these are superseded by the abolition
of the Red and Blue. The St. George's white ensign flag and pendant
alone are used.</p>

<p>DIVISIONS. The sub-classification of a ship's company under the lieutenants.
Also, a muster of the crew. Also, of an army, a force generally

whole. Of a battalion, a term sometimes used in exercise, when the companies
of a battalion have been equalized as to strength, for one of such
companies.</p>

fitted either to build ships in or to receive them to be repaired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
or breamed. They have strong flood-gates, to prevent the flux of the
tide from entering while the ship is under repair. There are likewise
docks where a ship can only be cleaned during the recess of the tide, as
she floats again on the return of the flood. Docks of the latter kind are
not furnished with the usual flood-gates; but the term is also used for
what is more appropriately called a <i><a href="#FLOAT">float</a></i> (which see). Also, in polar
parlance, an opening cut out of an ice-floe, into which a ship is warped
for security.</p>

disclosed were hushed up or patiently borne. It terminated about 1830.</p>

<p><a name="DOCKYARDS" id="DOCKYARDS"></a>DOCKYARDS. Arsenals containing all sorts of naval stores and timber
for ship-building. In England the royal dockyards are at Deptford,
Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Devonport, Pembroke.
Those in our colonies are at the Cape of Good Hope, Gibraltar, Malta,
Bermuda, Halifax, Jamaica, Antigua, Trincomalee, and Hong Kong.
There Her Majesty's ships and vessels of war are generally moored during
peace, and such as want repairing are taken into the docks, examined,
and refitted for service. These yards are generally supplied from the
north with hemp, pitch, tar, rosin, canvas, oak-plank, and several other
species of stores. The largest masts are usually imported from New
England. Until 1831 these yards were governed by a commissioner
resident at the port, who superintended all the musters of the officers,
artificers, and labourers employed in the dockyard and ordinary; he also
controlled their payment, examined their accounts, contracted and drew
bills on the Navy Office to supply the deficiency of stores, and, finally,
regulated whatever belonged to the dockyard. In 1831 the commissioners
of the Navy were abolished, and admirals and captains superintendent
command the dockyards under the controller of the Navy and the
Admiralty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<span class="sm1"><a href="#SEA-EGG">Sea-egg</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a name="ECLIPSE" id="ECLIPSE"></a>ECLIPSE. An obscuration of a heavenly body by the interposition of
another, or during its passage through the shadow of a larger body. An
<i>eclipse of the sun</i> is caused by the dark body of the moon passing between
it and the earth. When the moon's diameter exceeds the sun's, and
their centres nearly coincide, a <i>total eclipse</i> of the sun takes place; but if
the moon's diameter be less, then the eclipse is <i>annular</i>.</p>

<p><a name="ECLIPTIC" id="ECLIPTIC"></a>ECLIPTIC. The great circle of the heavens which the sun appears to us
to describe in the course of a year, in consequence of the earth's motion
round that luminary. It is inclined to the equinoctial at an angle of
nearly 23&deg; 28&#8242;, called the obliquity of the ecliptic, and cuts it in two
points diametrically opposite to each other, called the equinoctial points.
The time when the sun enters each of these points (which occurs about the
20th of March and 23d of September, respectively) is termed the equinox,
day and night being then equal; at these periods, especially about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
time of the vernal equinox, storms, called the equinoctial gales, are prevalent
in many parts of the globe. The two points of the ecliptic, which
are each 90&deg; distant from the equinoctial points, are called the
solstitial points. That great circle which passes through the equinoctial
points and the poles of the earth, is called the equinoctial colure; and that
which passes through the solstitial points and the poles of the earth, the
solstitial colure.</p>

<p>ECLIPTIC CONJUNCTION. Is the moon in conjunction with the sun
at the time of new moon, both luminaries having then the same longitude,

take place, and beyond which they cannot occur.</p>

<p>ECONOMY. A term expressive of the system and internal arrangement
pursued in a ship.</p>

<p>EDDY. Sometimes used for the dead-water under a ship's counter. Also,
the water that by some interruption in its course, runs contrary to the
direction of the tide or current, and appears like the motion of a whirlpool.
Eddies in the sea not unfrequently extend their influence to a
great distance, and are then merely regarded as contrary or revolving
currents. It is the back-curl of the water to fill a space or vacuum
formed sometimes by the faulty build of a vessel, having the after-body
fuller than the fore, which therefore impedes her motion. It also occurs
immediately after a tide passes a strait, where the volume of water spreads
suddenly out, and curves back to the edges. The Chinese pilots call
eddies, chow-chow water.</p>

<p>EDDY-TIDE. When the water runs back from some obstacle to the free
passage of the stream.</p>

<p>EDDY-WIND. That which is beat back, or returns, from a sail, bluff hill,
or anything which impedes its passage; in other words, whenever the edges
or veins of two currents of air, coming from opposite directions, meet,
they form an eddy, or <i><a href="#WHIRLWIND">whirlwind</a></i> (which see). They are felt generally
near high coasts intersected by ravines. The eddy-wind of a sail escaping,
in a curve, makes the sail abaft shiver.</p>

<p>EDGE AWAY, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To decline gradually from the course which the ship
formerly steered, by sailing larger, or more off, or more away from before
the wind than she had done before.</p>

<p>EDGE DOWN, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To approach any object in an oblique direction.</p>

lake, or out of another river. All tributaries are affluents.</p>

<p>EGG, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To instigate, incite, provoke, to urge on: from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>eggion</i>.</p>

<p>EGGS. These nutritious articles of food might be used longer at sea than
is usual. The shell of the egg abounds with small pores, through which
the aqueous part of the albumen constantly exhales, and the egg in consequence
daily becomes lighter, and approaches its decomposition. Reaumur
varnished them all over, and thus preserved eggs fresh for two years;
then carefully removing the varnish, he found that such eggs were still
capable of producing chickens. Some employ, with the same intention,
lard or other fatty substance for closing the pores, and others simply
immerse the egg for an instant in boiling water, by which its albumen
is in part coagulated, and the power of exhalation thereby checked. Eggs
packed in lime-water suffered to drain, have after three years' absence in
the West Indies been found good; this does not destroy vitality.</p>

<p><a name="EPHEMERIS" id="EPHEMERIS"></a>EPHEMERIS, <span class="sm1">or Nautical Almanac</span>. This in its wide sense, and recognizing
its value to navigators and astronomers, must be pronounced
one of the most useful of publications. How Drake and Magellan got
on is matter of marvel, for sailors were not especially administered to till
1675, when the <i>Kalendarium Nauticum</i>, by Henry Seaman, Mariner, appeared;
it comprised the usual matter of annual almanacs, and was enriched
with such precepts and rules in the practice of navigation and
traffic as are in daily use. But in 1767 our nautical almanac, a tabular
statement of the geocentric planetary positions, which may be said to have
created a new era in voyaging, was published; and this book, with certain
alterations, was in force up to 1830, when a commission of the Royal
Society and astronomers established the present <i>Ephemeris</i>, now so much
valued. It is published annually, but computed to four years in advance,
to accommodate those proceeding on long voyages. Attempts have been
made in other countries to publish <i>The Nautical Almanac</i>, improved and
corrected, but they are mere copies, corrected by the errata furnished
annually in advance.</p>

<p>FALLING TIDE, <span class="sm1">or Ebb of Tide</span>. This phrase, implying a previous

or ebbs during the next six hours. After a similar pause the
phenomenon recommences,&mdash;occupying altogether about twelve hours
and fifty minutes. A table of the daily time of high-water at each port
is requisite for the shipping. There are curious variations to this law,
as when strong rivers rise and fall, and yet do not admit salt water.

<p><a name="FINNER" id="FINNER"></a>FINNER. Whales of the genus <i>Bal&aelig;noptera</i> are so termed, being distinguished
from the right whales by the possession of a small triangular
adipose dorsal fin. There are several species, some of which grow to a
greater length than any other animals of the order, viz. 80 or perhaps
90 feet. They are very active and difficult to harpoon, yield comparatively
little oil, and their baleen, or "whalebone," is almost worthless;
consequently, they suffer much less than the right whales from the
persecutions of the whalers. The finner, or great black fish, is feared by
whalers in general. It is vicious, and can only be attacked by large boats
in shallow water, as at the Bermudas, where the whale-boats are about
50 or 60 feet long, and 12 feet beam. The fish yields one barrel of oil
for every foot in length beyond thirty. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#RAZOR-BACK">Razor-back</a></span> and <span class="sm1"><a href="#RORQUAL">Rorqual</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a name="FLAG" id="FLAG"></a>FLAG. A general name for the distinguishing colours of any nation. Also,
a certain banner by which an admiral is distinguished at sea from the
inferior ships of his squadron. The flags of the British navy were severally
on a red, white, or blue field, and were displayed from the top of the royal
pole of the main, fore, or mizen mast, according to the rank of the admiral,
thus indicating nine degrees. This diversity of colour has now been long
done away with. The white field, with the red St. George's cross, and
the sinister upper corner occupied by the union, is now alone used in the
British navy&mdash;the blue being assigned to the reserve, and the red to the
mercantile navy. An admiral still displays his flag exclusively at the
main truck; a vice-admiral at the fore; a rear-admiral at the mizen.
The first flag in importance is the royal standard of Great Britain and
Ireland, hoisted only when the king or queen is on board; the second is
the anchor of hope, for the lord high-admiral, or the lords-commissioners
of the admiralty; and the third is the union flag, for the admiral of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
fleet, who is the next officer under the lord high-admiral. The various
other departments, such as the navy board, custom-house, &amp;c., have each
their respective flags. Besides the national flag, merchant ships are permitted
to bear lesser flags on any mast, with the arms or design of the
firm to which they belong, but they "must not resemble or be mistaken
for any of the flags or signals used by the royal navy," under certain
penalties. When a council of war is held at sea, if it be on board the
admiral's ship, a flag is hung on the main-shrouds; if the vice-admiral's,
on the fore-shrouds; and if the rear-admiral's, on the mizen-shrouds. The
flags borne on the mizen were particularly called gallants. There are
also smaller flags used for signals. The word <i>flag</i> is often familiarly used
to denote the admiral himself. Also, the reply from the boat if an
admiral is on board&mdash;Flag!</p>

<p>FLAG-OFFICER. A term synonymous with <i>admiral</i>.</p>

<p>FLAG OF TRUCE. A white flag, hoisted to denote a wish to parley

<p>FLAG-SHARE. The admiral's share (one-eighth) in all captures made by
any vessels within the limits of his command, even if under the orders of
another admiral; but in cases of pirates, he has no claim unless he participates

<p>FLAT SEAM. The two edges or selvedges of canvas laid over each other
and sewed down.</p>

<p>FLAT SEIZING. This is passed on a rope, the same as a round seizing,
but it has no riding turns.</p>

<p>FLATTEN IN, <span class="sm1">To</span>. The action of hauling in the aftmost clue of a sail to
give it greater power of turning the vessel; thus, if the mizen or after sails
are flatted in, it is to carry the stern to leeward, and the head to windward;
and if, on the contrary, the head-sails are flatted in, the intention
is to make the ship fall off when, by design or accident, she has come so
near as to make the sails shiver; hence <i>flatten in forward</i> is the order to
haul in the jib and foretop-mast staysail-sheets towards the middle of the
ship, and haul forward the fore-bowline; this operation is seldom necessary
except when the helm has not sufficient government of the ship, as in
variable winds or inattentive steerage.</p>

fleet of ships of war is usually divided into three squadrons, and these, if
numerous, are again separated into subdivisions. The admiral commands
the centre, the second in command superintends the vanguard, and the

a squadron, or rear-admiral's command, composed of five sail-of-the-line,
with any amount of smaller vessels.</p>

the 'thwart boards forming the circumference and force of the paddle-wheels
of steamers.</p>

<p>FLOE. A field of floating ice of any extent, as beyond the range of
vision, for notwithstanding its cracks the floes pressed together are assumed
as one; hence, if ships make fast to the floe-edge, and it parts from the
main body, sail is made, and the ship goes to the next available floe-edge.</p>

<p><a name="FLOGGING_THE_GLASS" id="FLOGGING_THE_GLASS"></a>FLOGGING THE GLASS. Where there is no ship time-piece the watches

<p>FLOWERING. The phenomenon observed usually in connection with
the spawning of fish, at the distance of four leagues from shore. The
water appears to be saturated with a thick jelly, filled with the ova of
fish, which is known by its adhering to the ropes that the cobles anchor
with while fishing, for they find the first six or seven fathom of rope free
from spawn, the next ten or twelve covered with slimy matter, and the
remainder again free to the bottom; this gelatinous material may supply
the new-born fry with food, and protect them by clouding the water.</p>

<p>FLOWING-HOPE. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#FORLORN_HOPE">Forlorn Hope</a></span>.</p>

<p>FLOWING-SHEET. In sailing free or large, is the position of the sheets
or lower clues of the principal sails when they are eased off to the wind,
so as to receive it more nearly perpendicular than when they are close-hauled,
although more obliquely than when going before the wind; a ship
is therefore said to have a flowing-sheet, when the wind crosses the line of
her course nearly at right angles; that is to say, a ship steering due north
with the wind at east, or directly on her side, will have a flowing-sheet;
whereas, if the sheets were hauled close aft, she would sail two points
nearer the wind&mdash;viz. N.N.E. This explanation will probably be better
understood by considering the yards as plane faces of wedges&mdash;the more
oblique fore and aft, the less head-way force is given, until 22&deg; before the
transverse line or beam. This is the swiftest line of sailing. As the
wind draws aft of the beam the speed decreases (unless the wind increases),
so that a vessel with the wind abeam, and every sail drawing, goes much
faster than she would with the same wind before it.</p>

<p>FLUCTUATION <span class="sm1">of the Tide</span>. The rising and falling of the waters.</p>

<p><a name="FLUE" id="FLUE"></a>FLUE. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#FLUKES">Flukes</a></span>.</p>

(double) depth of 1 inch at the poles.</p>

<p><a name="FLUKES" id="FLUKES"></a>FLUKES. The two parts which constitute the large triangular tail of the

or palms, are also the broad triangular plates of iron on each arm of the
anchor, inside the bills or extreme points, which having entered the
ground, hold the ship. Seamen, by custom, drop the <i>k</i>, and pronounce
the word <i>flue</i>.</p>

flutters loose in the wind. If an ensign, the part which extends from the
union to the outer part; the vertical height, to the head-toggle of which
the halliards are bent, or which is next to the staff, is called the <i>hoist</i>;
the lower (which is a rope rove through the canvas heading, and into
which the head-toggle is spliced) is the long tack; on this rope the whole
strain is sustained.</p>

that a Dutch skipper, irritated with a foul wind, swore by <i>donner</i> and
<i>blitzen</i>, that he would beat into Table Bay in spite of God or man, and

<p><a name="FOG" id="FOG"></a>FOG. A mist at sea, consisting of the grosser vapours floating in the air
near the surface of the sea. The fog of the great bank of Newfoundland
is caused by the near proximity of warm and cold waters. The air over
the Gulf Stream, being warmer than that over the banks of Newfoundland,
is capable of keeping much more moisture in invisible suspension;
and when this air comes in contact with that above the cold water, it
parts with some of its moisture, or rather holds it in visible suspension.
There are also dry fogs, which are dust held in suspension, as the so-called
African dust, which often partially obscures the sun, and reddens the sails
of ships as they pass through the north-east trades.</p>

<p>FOG-BANK. A dense haze, presenting the appearance of a thick cloud
resting upon the horizon; it is known in high latitudes as the precursor
of wind from the quarter in which it appears. From its frequent
resemblance to land it has obtained the name of <i>Cape Fly-away</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>FOG-BOW. A beautiful natural phenomenon incidental to high latitudes.
It appears opposite to the sun, and is usually broad and white, but sometimes
assumes the prismatic colours. Indicative of clearing off of mists.

<p>FOG-DOGS. Those transient prismatic breaks which occur in thick mists,
and considered good symptoms of the weather clearing.</p>

<p><a name="FOG-EATER" id="FOG-EATER"></a>FOG-EATER. A synonym of <i>fog-dog</i> and <i>fog-bow</i>. It may be explained
as the clearing of the upper stratum, permitting the sun's rays to exhibit
at the horizon prismatic colours; hence "sun-gall."</p>

<p>FOGEY. An old-fashioned or singular person; an invalid soldier or sailor.
Often means a stupid but irascible fellow.</p>

<p>FOGGY. Not quite sober.</p>

<p>FOGRAM. Wine, beer, or spirits of indifferent quality; in fact, any kind

<p>FOLLIS. A net with very large meshes, principally for catching thorn-backs.</p>

<p>FOLLOWERS. A certain number of men permitted by the regulations of
the service to be taken by the captain when he removes from one ship to
another. Also, the young gentlemen introduced into the service by the
captain, and reared with a father's care, moving with him from ship to
ship; a practice which produced most of our best officers formerly, but
innovation has broken through it, to the serious detriment of the service
and the country.</p>

various works for conducting a siege. It is <i>natural</i> when it opposes
rocks, woods, marshes, ravines, &amp;c., to impede the progress of an enemy;

<p>FOUL ANCHOR. An anchor is said to be <i>foul</i>, or <i>fouled</i>, either when
it hooks some impediment under water, or when the ship, by the wind
shifting, entangles her slack cable a turn round the stock, or round the
upper fluke thereof. The last, from its being avoidable by a sharp look-out,
is termed the seaman's disgrace.</p>

or nearly so, along the crest of the escarp, or sometimes of the counterscarp;
being generally concealed from direct artillery fire they very
materially increase the difficulty of either of those slopes to an assailant.

<p>FRAPPING. The act of crossing and drawing together the several parts
of a tackle, or other complication of ropes, which had already been strained
to a great extent; in this sense it exactly resembles the operation of bracing
up a drum. The frapping increases tension, and consequently adds to
the security acquired by the purchase; hence the cat-harpings were no
other than frappings to the shrouds.</p>

<p><a name="FRAPPING_A_SHIP" id="FRAPPING_A_SHIP"></a>FRAPPING A SHIP. The act of passing four or five turns of a large
cable-laid rope round a ship's hull when it is apprehended that she is not

as long as possible, insuring them deeply. Such are termed, not unaptly,
floating coffins, as were also the old, 10-gun brigs, or any vessel deemed
doubtful as to sea-worthiness. St. Paul's ship was "undergirded" or
frapped.</p>

change their degree of freezing in accordance with mixtures of alcohol
or solutions of salt used for the purpose. Also, according to the atmospheric
pressure; and by this law heights of mountains are measured by
the boiling temperature of water.</p>

<p>FREIGHT. By former English maritime law it became the <i>mother of
wages</i>, as the crew were obliged to moor the ship on her return in the
docks or forfeit them. So severely was the axiom maintained, that if a
ship was lost by misfortune, tempest, enemy, or fire, wages also were
forfeited, because the freight out of which they were to arise had perished
with it. This harsh measure was intended to augment the care of the
seamen for the welfare of the ship, but no longer holds, for by the merchant
shipping act it is enacted that no right of wages shall be dependent
on the earning of freight; in cases of wreck, however, proof that a man
has not done his utmost bars his claim. Also, for the burden or lading
of a ship. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#DEAD-FREIGHT">Dead-freight</a></span>.) Also, a duty of 50 sols per ton formerly
paid to the government of France by the masters of foreign vessels going

very peculiar term, dependent on the stability of the ship, her management,
and how she is affected by it, on a wind or before it. It is numbered
6. Thus, a ship running down the trades, with studding-sails set,
had registered "moderate and fine;" she met with a superior officer, close-hauled
under close-reefed top-sails and courses, was compelled to shorten
sail, and lower her boat; the log was then marked "fresh breezes."</p>

of fresh water in the Canadas. Of these, Lake Superior is upwards of
1500 miles in circuit, with a depth of 70 fathoms near the shores, while
Michigan and Huron are almost as prodigious; even Erie is 600 miles
round, and Ontario near 500, and Nepigon, the head of the system geographically,
though the least important at present commercially, but just
now partially explored, is fully 400. Their magnitude, however, appears
likely to be rivalled geographically by the lakes lately discovered in
Central Africa, the Victoria Nyanza and the Albert Nyanza.</p>

called the Gulf of Constantinople; the Adriatic Sea, called also the Gulf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of Venice; the Mediterranean is itself a prodigious specimen. A gulf
is, strictly speaking, distinguished from a sea in being smaller, and from
a bay in being larger and deeper than it is broad. It is observed that the
sea is always most dangerous near gulfs, from the currents being penned
up by the shores.</p>

<p>GULF-STREAM. Is especially referable to that of Mexico, the waters of
which flow in a warm stream at various velocities over the banks between
Cuba and America, past the Bermudas, touch the tail of the great bank
of Newfoundland, and thence in a sweep to Europe, part going north, and
the other southerly down to the tropics again.</p>

<p><a name="GUN" id="GUN"></a>GUN. The usual service name for a <i><a href="#CANNON">cannon</a></i> (which see); it was originally
called great gun, to distinguish it from the small or hand guns, muskets,
blunderbusses, &amp;c. The general construction for guns of cast metal is fairly
represented by the old rule that the circumference at the breech ought to
measure eleven calibres, at the trunnions nine, and at the muzzle seven,
for iron; and in each instance two calibres less for brass guns. But the
introduction of wrought-iron guns, built up with outer jackets of metal
shrunk on one above another, is developing other names and proportions
in the new artillery. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BUILT-UP_GUNS">Built-up Guns</a></span>.) The weight of these latter,
though differently disposed, and required not so much for strength as for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
modifying the recoil or shock to the carriage on discharge, is not very
much less, proportionally, for heavy guns of full power, than that of the
old ones, being about 1<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> cwt. of gun for every 1 lb. of shot; for light guns
for field purposes it is about <span class="abv">3</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">4</span> cwt. for every 1 lb. of shot. Guns are
generally designated from the weight of the shot they discharge, though
some few natures, introduced principally for firing shells, were distinguished
by the diameter of their bore in inches; with the larger guns of
the new system, in addition to this diameter, the weight in tons is also
specified.&mdash;<i>Gun</i>, in north-country cant, meant a large flagon of ale, and
<i>son of a gun</i> was a jovial toper: the term, owed its derivation to lads
born under the breast of the lower-deck guns in olden times, when women
were allowed to accompany their husbands. Even in 1820 the best petty
officers were allowed this indulgence, about one to every hundred men.
Gunners also, who superintended the youngsters, took their wives, and
many living admirals can revert to kindness experienced from them.
These "sons of a gun" were tars, and no mistake.&mdash;<i>Morning gun</i>, a signal
fired by an admiral or commodore at day-break every morning for the
drums or bugles to sound the reveill&eacute;. A gun of like name and nature
is generally in use in fortresses; as is also the <i>evening gun</i>, fired by an
admiral or commodore at 9 <span class="sm2">P.M.</span> in summer, and 8 <span class="sm2">P.M.</span> in winter, every
night, on which the drums or bugles sound the retreat.</p>

<p>GUN AND HEAD MONEY. Given to the captors of an enemy's ship

<p>GUNBOAT. A light-draught boat fitted to carry one or more cannon in
the bow, so as to cannonade an enemy while she is end-on. They are
principally useful in fine weather, to cover the landing of troops, or such
other occasions. They were formerly impelled by sails and sweeps
but now by steam-power, which has generally increased their size, and
much developed their importance. According to Froissart, cannon were
fired from boats in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>GUN-CHAMBERS. In early artillery, a movable chamber with a handle,
like a paterero, used in loading at the breech. In more recent times
the name has been used for the small portable mortars for firing salutes

<p>GUN-LOD. A vessel filled with combustibles, but rather for explosion
than as a fire-ship.</p>

<p>GUN-METAL. The alloy from which brass guns are cast consists of 100
parts of copper to 10 of tin, retaining much of the tenacity of the former,
and much harder than either of the components; but the late improved
working of wrought-iron and steel has nearly superseded its application
to guns.</p>

<p>GUNNADE. A short 32-pounder gun of 6 feet, introduced in 1814;
afterwards termed the shell-gun.</p>

<p><a name="GUNPOWDER" id="GUNPOWDER"></a>GUNPOWDER. The well-known explosive composition which, for its
regularity of effect and convenience in manufacture and use, is still preferred
for general purposes to all the new and more violent but more
capricious agents. In England it is composed of 75 parts saltpetre to 10
sulphur and 15 charcoal; these proportions are varied slightly in different
countries. The ingredients are mixed together with great mechanical
nicety, and the compound is then pressed and granulated. On the application
of fire it is converted into gas with vast explosive power, but
subject to tolerably well-known laws.</p>

<p>GUN-ROOM. A compartment on the after-end of the lower gun-deck of
large ships of war, partly occupied by the junior officers; but in smaller

<p>GUN-SHOT. Formerly, the distance up to which a gun would throw a
shot direct to its mark, without added elevation; as the "<a href="#LINE-OF-METAL_ELEVATION">line of metal</a>"
(which see) was generally used in laying, this range was about 800 yards.
But now that ranges are so greatly increased, with but slight additions to
the elevation, the term will include the distances of ordinary "<a href="#HORIZONTAL_FIRE">horizontal
fire</a>" (which see); as between ships, with rifled guns, it will not quite
reach two miles: though when the mark is large, as a town or dockyard,
it is still within long range at five miles' distance.</p>

<p>GUN-SIGHT. <i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#DISPART">Dispart</a></span>, or <span class="sm1"><a href="#SIGHTS">Sights</a></span>.</p>

and 10 is 10,000, &amp;c.</p>

<p>GUNTER'S QUADRANT. A kind of stereographic projection on the
plane of the equinoctial; the eye is supposed in one of the poles, so that
the tropic, ecliptic, and horizon form the arches of the circles, but the
hour-circles are all curves, drawn by means of several altitudes of the sun,
for some particular latitude, for every day in the year. The use of this
instrument is to find the hour of the day, the sun's azimuth, and other
common problems of the globe; as also to take the altitude of an object in
degrees.</p>

<p><a name="GUNWALE" id="GUNWALE"></a>GUNWALE, <span class="sm1">or Gunnel</span>. Nearly synonymous with <i><a href="#PLANK-SHEER">plank-sheer</a></i> (which

<p>GURNARD. A fish of the genus <i>Trigla</i>, so called from its peculiar
grunt when removed from the water. Falstaff uses the term "soused
gurnet" in a most contemptuous view, owing to its poorness; and its head
being all skin and bone gave rise to the saying that the flesh on a gurnard's
head is rank poison.</p>

<p>GURNET-PENDANT. A rope, the thimble of which is hooked to the
quarter-tackle of the main-yard; it is led through a hole in the deck, for

ship's side while it is hoisting or lowering, particularly when, there is a
high sea. Also, a rope extended from the head of sheers, and made fast at
a distance on each side to steady them. The jib-boom is supported by its
guys. Also, the name of a tackle used to confine a boom forward, when
a vessel is going large, and so prevent the sail from gybing, which would
endanger the springing of the boom, or perhaps the upsetting of the vessel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>

as Falconer has it, "the tempest to disarm;" so by handing in this
leech-rope before the yard, the canvas is easily folded in, and the gasket
passed round.</p>

<p><a name="HARPINGS" id="HARPINGS"></a>HARPINGS, <span class="sm1">or Harpens</span>. The fore-parts of the wales which encompass
the bow of a ship, and are fastened to the stem, being thicker than the after-part
of the wales, in order to strengthen the ship in that place where she
sustains the greatest shock of resistance in plunging into the sea, or dividing
it, under a great pressure of sail. Also, the pieces of oak, similar to
ribbands, but trimmed and bolted to the shape of the body of the ship,
which hold the fore and after cant bodies together, until the ship is
planked. But this term is mostly applicable to those at the bow; hence
arises the phrase "clean and full harpings." Harpings in the bow of a
vessel are decried as rendering the ship uneasy.&mdash;<i>Cat harpings.</i> The legs
which cross from futtock-staff to futtock-staff, below the tops, to girt in
the rigging, and allow the lower yards to brace sharp up.</p>

<p><a name="HARPOON" id="HARPOON"></a>HARPOON, <span class="sm1">or Harpago</span>. A spear or javelin with a barbed point, used
to strike whales and other fish. The harpoon is furnished with a long
shank, and has at one end a broad and flat triangular head, sharpened at
both edges so as to penetrate the whale with facility, but blunt behind
to prevent its cutting out. To the other end a fore-ganger is bent, to
which is fastened a long cord called the whale-line, which lies carefully
coiled in the boat in such a manner as to run out without being interrupted
or entangled. Several coils, each 130 fathoms of whale-line (soft
laid and of clean silky fibre) are in readiness; the instant the whale is
struck the men cant the oars, so that the roll may not immerse them in
the water. The line, which has a turn round the bollard, flies like
lightning, and is intensely watched. One man pours water on the
smoking bollard, another is ready with a sharp axe to cut, and the others
see that the lines run free. Seven or eight coils have been run out
before the whale "sounds," or strikes bottom, when he rises again to
breathe, and probably gets a similar dose.&mdash;<i>Gun harpoon.</i> A weapon
used for the same purpose as the preceding, but it is fired out of a gun,
instead of being thrown by hand; it is made entirely of steel, and has a
chain or long shackle attached to it, to which the whale-line is fastened.
Greener's harpoon-gun is a kind of wall-piece fixed in a crutch, which
steps into the bow-bollard of the whale-boat. The harpoon projects
about four inches beyond the muzzle. It consists of its barbed point
attached to a long link, with a solid button at its opposite end to fit the
gun; on one rod of this link is a ring which runs to the muzzle, and is
there attached to the whale-line by a thong of seal or walrus hide, wet.
The gun being fired, the harpoon is projected, the ring sliding up to the
button, when the line follows. Some of these harpoons or other engines
have grenades&mdash;glass globules with prussic acid or other chemicals&mdash;which
sicken the whale instantly, and little trouble ensues.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>HASTAN. The Manx or Erse term for a large eel or conger.</p>

<p>HASTY-PUDDING. A batter made of flour or oatmeal stirred in boiling
water, and eaten with treacle or sugar at sea. This dish is not altogether
to be despised in need, although Lord Dorset&mdash;the sailor poet&mdash;speaks of
it disparagingly:</p>

passages up and down from one deck to another, and again
descending into the hold. The coverings over these openings are called
hatches. Goods of bulk are let down into the hold by the hatchways.
To lay anything in the hatchway, is to put it so that the hatches cannot
be approached or opened. The hatches of a smaller kind are distinguished
by the name of <i>scuttles</i>.</p>

instead of gratings, for security and circulation of air. They arrest
the fall of any one from a deck above.</p>

<p><a name="HAWSE" id="HAWSE"></a>HAWSE. This is a term of great meaning. Strictly, it is that part of a
vessel's bow where holes are cut for her cables to pass through. It is
also generally understood to imply the situation of the cables before the
ship's stem, when she is moored with two anchors out from forward, one on
the starboard, and the other on the port bow. It also denotes any small
distance between her head and the anchors employed to ride her, as "he
has anchored in our hawse," "the brig fell athwart our hawse," &amp;c.
Also, said of a vessel a little in advance of the stem; as, she sails <i>athwart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
hawse</i>, or has anchored <i>in the hawse</i>. If a vessel drives at her anchors
into the hawse of another she is said to "<i>foul the hawse</i>" of the vessel
riding there; hence the threat of a man-of-war's-man, "If you foul my
hawse, I'll cut your cable," no merchant vessel being allowed to approach
a ship-of-war within certain limits, and never to make fast to the government
buoys.&mdash;<i>A bold hawse</i> is when the holes are high above the water.
"Freshen hawse," or "veer out more cable," is said when part of the cable
that lies in the hawse is fretted or chafed, and more should be veered out,
so that another part of it may rest in the hawse. "Freshen hawse" also
means, clap a service on or round the cable in the hawses to prevent it
from fretting; hemp cables only are rounded or cackled. Also, a dram
after fatiguing duty. "Clearing hawse," is untwisting or disentangling
two cables that come through different holes, and make a foul hawse.</p>

<p>HAWSE-BAGS. Canvas bags filled with oakum, used in heavy seas to
stop the hawse-holes and prevent the water coming in.</p>

<p>HAWSE-BLOCKS. Bucklers, or pieces of wood made to fit over the
hawse-holes when at sea, to back the hawse-plugs.</p>

<p>HAWSE-BOLSTERS. Planks above and below the hawse-holes. Also,
pieces of canvas stuffed with oakum and roped round, for plugging when
the cables are bent.</p>

<p>HAWSE-FALLEN. To ride hawse-fallen, is when the water breaks into
the hawse in a rough sea, driving all before it.</p>

<p>HAWSE-FULL. Riding hawse-full; pitching bows under.</p>

<p>HAWSE-HOLES. Cylindrical holes cut through the bows of a ship on
each side of the stem, through which the cables pass, in order to be drawn
into or let out of the vessel, as occasion requires.</p>

<p>HAWSE-HOOK. A compass breast timber which crosses the hawse-timber
above the ends of the upper-deck planking, and over the hawse-holes.
(<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BREAST-HOOKS">Breast-hooks</a></span>.)</p>

<p>HAWSE-PIECES. The timbers which compose the bow of a vessel,
and their sides look fore and aft; it is a name given to the foremost
timbers of a ship, whose lower ends rest upon the knuckle-timbers. They
are generally parallel to the stem, having their upper ends sometimes
terminated by the lower part of the beak-head and otherwise by the top
of the bow. Also, timbers through which the hawse-holes are cut.</p>

<p>HAWSE-PIPE. A cast-iron pipe in the hawse-holes to prevent the cable
from cutting the wood.</p>

<p>HAWSE-PLUGS. Blocks of wood made to fit into the hawse-pipes, and
put in from the outside to stop the hawses, and thereby prevent the water
from washing into the manger. The plug, coated with old canvas, is first
inserted, then a mat or swab, and over it the buckler or shield, which
bolts upward and downward into the breast-hooks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="HAWSER" id="HAWSER"></a>HAWSER. A large rope or cablet, which holds the middle degree between
the cable and tow-line, being a size smaller than the former, and as much
larger than the latter; curiously, it is not hawser but cable laid.</p>

<p>HAWSER-LAID ROPE. Is rope made in the usual way, being three or
four strands of yarns laid up right-handed, or with the sun; it is used for
small running rigging, as well as for standing rigging, shrouds, &amp;c.; in the
latter case it is generally tarred to keep out rain. It is supposed that
this style of rope is stronger in proportion to the number of yarns than
cable or water-laid rope, which is more tightly twisted, each strand being
a small rope. This latter is more impervious to water, and therefore
good for cables, hawsers, &amp;c.; it is laid left-handed, or against the sun.</p>

enlarged sense, the whole fore-part of a ship, including the bows on each
side; the head therefore opens the column of water through which the
ship passes when advancing; hence we say, <i>head-way</i>, <i>head-sails</i>, <i>head-sea</i>,
&amp;c. It is evident that the fore-part of a ship is called its head, from its
analogy to that of a fish, or any animal while swimming. Also, in a confined
sense, to that part on each side of the stem outside the bows proper
which is appropriated to the use of the sailors for wringing swabs, or any
wet jobs, for no wet is permitted in-board after the decks are dried. Also,
hydrographically, the upper part of a gulf, bay, or creek.&mdash;<i>By the head</i>,
the state of a ship which, by her lading, draws more water forward than
aft. This may be remedied without reference to cargo in ships-of-war, by

<p>HEAD-SAILS. A general name for all those sails which may be set on
the fore-mast and bowsprit, jib, and flying jib-boom, and employed to influence
the fore-part of the ship.</p>

<p>HEAD-SEA. A name given to the waves when they oppose a ship's course,
as the ship must rise over, or cut through each. Their effect depends
upon their height, form, and speed; sometimes they are steep, quick, and
irregular, so that a ship is caught by a second before she has recovered

<p><a name="HOG" id="HOG"></a>HOG. A kind of rough, flat scrubbing broom, serving to scrape a ship's
bottom under water, particularly in the act of <i><a href="#BOOT-TOPPING">boot-topping</a></i> (which see);
formed by inclosing a multitude of short twigs of birch, or the like,
between two pieces of plank, which are firmly attached to each other;
the ends of the twigs are then cut off even, so as to form a brush of considerable
extent. To this is fitted a long staff, together with two ropes,
the former of which is used to thrust the hog under the ship's bottom,
and the latter to guide and pull it up again close to the planks, so as to
rub off all the dirt. This work is usually performed in the ship's boat.</p>

<p><a name="HOGGED" id="HOGGED"></a>HOGGED. A significant word derived from the animal; it implies that
the two ends of a ship's decks droop lower than the midship part, consequently,

<p>HOLLOW SHOT. Introduced principally for naval use before the
horizontal firing of shells from guns became general. Their weight was
about two-thirds that of the solid shot; thus they required less charge of
powder and weight of gun than the latter, whilst their smashing effect

In wind-bound ships in former times the left hands of several boys were
tied to a hoop, and their right armed with a nettle, they being naked
down to the waist. On the boatswain giving one a cut with his cat, the
boy struck the one before him, and each one did the same, beginning
gently, but, becoming irritated, they at last laid on in earnest. Also, a
nautical punishment for quarrelsome fighters was, that two offenders,
similarly fastened, thrashed each other until one gave in. The craven
was usually additionally punished by the commander.</p>

<p><a name="HORIZON" id="HORIZON"></a>HORIZON. The apparent or visible circle which bounds our vision at sea;
it is that line which is described by the sky and water appearing to meet.
This is designated as the <i>sensible</i> horizon; the <i>rational</i>, or <i>true</i> one, being
a great circle of the heavens, parallel to the sensible horizon, but passing
through the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>HORIZON-GLASSES. Two small speculums on one of the radii of a
quadrant or sextant; the one half of the fore horizon-glass is silvered,
while the other half is transparent, in order that an object may be seen
directly through it: the back horizon-glass is silvered above and below,
but in the middle there is a transparent stripe through which the horizon
can be seen.</p>

<p>HORIZONTAL. A direction parallel to the horizon, or what is commonly
termed lying flat. One of the greatest inconveniences navigators have to
struggle with is the frequent want of a distinct sight of the horizon. To
obviate this a <i>horizontal spinning speculum</i> was adopted by Mr. Lerson,
who was lost in the <i>Victory</i> man-of-war, in which ship he was sent out to
make trial of his instrument. This was afterwards improved by Smeaton,
and consists of a well-polished metal speculum about 3<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> inches in
diameter, inclosed within a circular rim of brass, so fitted that the centre
of gravity of the whole shall fall near the point on which it spins. This
is the end of a steel axis running through the centre of the speculum,
above which it finishes in a square for the convenience of fitting a roller
on it, bearing a piece of tape wound round it. The cup in which it
spins is made of agate flint, or other hard substance. Sextants, with
spirit-levels attached, have latterly been used, as well as Becher's horizon;
but great dexterity is demanded for anything like an approximation to
the truth; wherefore this continues to be a great desideratum in navigation.</p>

<p><a name="HORIZONTAL_FIRE" id="HORIZONTAL_FIRE"></a>HORIZONTAL FIRE. From artillery, is that in which the piece is laid
either direct on the object, or with but small elevation above it, the limit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>

circumstances, and includes all other varieties, with the exception
of vertical fire, which has elevations of from 30&deg; and upwards; and,
according to some few, curved fire, an intermediate kind, of limited
application.</p>

for the sailors to tread on while they are loosing, reefing, or furling the
sails, rigging out the studding-sail booms, &amp;c. In order to keep the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
horse more parallel to the yard, it is usually attached thereto at proper
distances, by certain ropes called stirrups, which have an eye spliced into
their lower ends, through which the horse passes. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#STIRRUPS">Stirrups</a></span> and
<span class="sm1"><a href="#FOOT-ROPES">Foot-ropes</a></span>.) Also, a rope formerly fast to the fore-mast fore-shrouds,
with a dead-eye to receive the spritsail-sheet-pendant, and keep the spritsail-sheets
clear of the flukes of the anchor. Also, the breast-rope which
is made fast to the shrouds to protect the leadsman. Also, applied to
any pendant and thimble through which running-rigging was led, now
commonly called a lizard. Also, a thick rope, extending in a perpendicular
direction near the fore or after side of a mast, for the purpose of
hoisting some yard, or extending a sail thereon; when before the mast, it
is used for the square-sail, whose yard is attached to the horse by means
of a traveller or bull's-eye, which slides up and down. When it is abaft
the mast, it is intended for the trysail of a snow; but is seldom used in
this position, except in those sloops of war which occasionally assume the
appearance of snows to deceive the enemy. Also, the name of the

bar, with a large thimble, which spans the vessel from side to side close
to the deck before the fore-mast. To this the forestaysail-sheet is hauled,
and traverses. The other horse is a similar bar abaft, on which the main-boom
sheet traverses. Also, cross-pieces on the tops of standards, on
which the booms or spare-spars or boats are lashed between the fore and
main masts. Horses are also termed jack-stays, on which sails are hauled
out, as gaff-sails. Horse is a term of derision where an officer assumes
the grandioso, demanding honour where honour is not his due. Also, a
strict disciplinarian, in nautical parlance. Also, tough salt beef&mdash;<i>salt
horse</i>.&mdash;<i>Flemish horse</i> is the horse which has an iron thimble in one
end, which goes over the iron point of the yard-arm before the studding-sail
boom-iron is put on; in the other, a lashing eye, which is secured
near the head earing of the top-sail. It is intended for the men at the
earing in reefing, or when setting the top-gallant-studding-sails.</p>

<p>HORSE-ARTILLERY. A branch of field artillery specially equipped to
man&#339;uvre with cavalry, having lighter guns, and all its gunners mounted

<p><a name="HORSE-POWER" id="HORSE-POWER"></a>HORSE-POWER. A comparative estimate of the capacity of steam-engines,
by assuming a certain average effective pressure of steam, and a
certain average linear velocity of the piston. The pressure multiplied
by the velocity gives the effective force of the engine exerted through a
given number of feet per minute; and since the force called a horse-power
means 33,000 lbs. acting thus one foot per minute, it follows that
the nominal power of the engine will be found by dividing the effective
force exerted by the piston, multiplied by the number of feet per minute
through which it acts by 33,000.</p>

materials and form are equally various, and so is their origin; some
having evidently been upheaved by volcanic eruption, others are the
result of accretion, and still more revealing by their strata that they

timbers. The keel is generally composed of several thick pieces placed
lengthways, which, after being scarphed together, are bolted and clinched
upon the upper side. In iron vessels the keel is formed of one or more
plates of iron, having a concave curve, or limber channel, along its upper
surface.&mdash;<i>To give the keel</i>, is to careen.&mdash;<i>Keel</i> formerly meant a vessel; so
many "keels struck the sands." Also, a low flat-bottomed vessel used on

and fayed upon the fore-part of a ship's stem, supporting the ornamental
figure. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#HEAD">Head</a></span>.) Besides which, this piece is otherwise useful as
serving to secure the boom or bumkin, by which the fore-tack is extended
to windward, and by its great breadth preventing the ship from falling
to leeward, when close-hauled, so much as she would otherwise be liable
to do. It also affords security to the bowsprit by increasing the angle of
the bobstay, so as to make it act more perpendicularly on the bowsprit.
The <i>knee of the head</i> is a phrase peculiar to shipwrights; by seamen it is
called the <i><a href="#CUT-WATER">cut-water</a></i> (which see).</p>

also formerly denoted in many merchant ships, two strong frames
of timber fixed on the main-deck, a little behind the fore-mast, which supported
the ends of the windlass. They were frequently called the <i>bitts</i>,
and then their upper parts only were denominated the knight-heads,
from having been embellished with a carved head. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#WINDLASS">Windlass</a></span>.)
Also, a name formerly given to the lower jear-blocks, which were then
no other than bitts, containing several sheaves, and nearly resembling

<p>KNOCK OFF WORK <span class="sm1">and Carry Deals</span>. A term used to deride the

really knocking off work.</p>

<p><a name="KNOLL" id="KNOLL"></a>KNOLL. The top of a rounded hill; the head of a bank, or the most elevated

<p><a name="KNOT" id="KNOT"></a>KNOT. A large knob formed on the extremity of a rope, generally by
untwisting its ends, and interweaving them regularly among each other;
of these there are several sorts, differing in form, size, and name, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
diamond knot, kop knot, overhand knot, reef knot, shroud knot, stopper
knot, single wall knot, double wall knot. The bowline knot is so firmly
made, and fastened to the cringles of the sails, that they must break, or
the sails split, before it will slip. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#RUNNING_BOWLINE-KNOT">Running Bowline</a></span>.) The sheepshank
knot serves to shorten a rope without cutting it, and may be presently
loosened. The wall-knot is so made with the lays of a rope that
it cannot slip, and serves for sheets, tacks, and stoppers. Knots are
generally used to act as a button, in preventing the end of a rope from
slipping through the hole of a dead-eye, or through the turns of a laniard,
by which they are sometimes made fast to other ropes.&mdash;<i>Knot</i> also implies
a division on the log line, bearing a similar proportion to a mile,
which half a minute does to an hour; that is, it is <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">120</span> of a mile; hence
we say, the ship was going 8 knots, signifying 8 miles per hour. Indeed,
in nautical parlance, the words knot and mile are synonyms, alluding to
the geographical mile of 60&#8242; to a degree of latitude.</p>

capacity. If the goods be heavy, her burden is determined by weight;
but if light, she carries as much as she can conveniently stow. A ton in
measure is estimated at 2000 lbs. in weight; a vessel of 200 tons ought
therefore to carry a weight equal to 400,000 lbs.; but if she cannot float
high enough with as great a quantity of it as her hold will contain, then a
diminution of it becomes necessary. Vessels carry heavy goods by the ton
of 20 cwt., but lighter goods by a ton of cubic feet, which varies according
to the custom of the port; in London it is 40, in India from 50 to 52,
depending on the goods. Vessels can carry (not safely) twice their tonnage.</p>

the bow. The Italians derive starboard from <i>questa borda</i>, "this side,"

Mediterranean. A launch being proportionably longer, lower, and more
flat-bottomed than the merchantman's long-boat, is in consequence less
fit for sailing, but better calculated for rowing and approaching a flat
shore. Its principal superiority consists in being much fitter to under-run
the cable, lay out anchors, &amp;c., which is a very necessary employment
in the harbours of the Levant, where the cables of different ships are
fastened across each other, and frequently render such operations necessary.</p>

<p>LAUNCH, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To send a ship, craft, or boat off the slip on shore into
the water, "her native element," as newspapers say. Also, to move

the incline under the bottom of a ship; otherwise called <i>bilge-ways</i>. On

<p>LAW OF NATIONS. It was originally merely the necessary law of
nature applied to nations, as in the instance of receiving distressed ships
with humanity. By various conventional compacts, the Law of Nations
became positive; thus flags of truce are respected, and prisoners are not
put to death. One independent state is declared incompetent to prescribe
to another, so long as that state is innoxious to its neighbours. The Law
of Nations consists of those principles and regulations, founded in reason
and general convenience, by which the mutual intercourse between independent
states is everywhere conducted.</p>

pilots prefer their own marks, as in the Hooghly, where they always
measure the line for themselves. The term "deep-sea line" must not
now be confined to the use of the lead for the ordinary purposes of safe
navigation; deep-sea soundings for scientific purposes are recorded in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>

<p>LOG-BOARD. Two boards shutting together like a book, and divided
into several columns, in which to record, through the hours of the day
and night, the direction of the wind and the course of the ship, with all
the material occurrences, together with the latitude by observation. From
this table the officers work the ship's way, and compile their journals.
The whole being written by the mate of the watch with chalk, is rubbed
out every day at noon. Now a slate is more generally used.</p>

<p><a name="LOG-BOOK" id="LOG-BOOK"></a>LOG-BOOK. Mostly called the log, is a journal into which the log-board

notice. The intermediate divisions or watches are usually signed by the
commanding officer. It is also divided into <i>harbour-log</i> and <i>sea-log</i>.</p>

<p>LOG-CANOE. One hollowed out of a single log. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#CANOE">Canoe</a></span>.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

disused, as a mark of disgrace, by recording the omissions of an officer. It
may yet be demanded if arrest ensues.</p>

<p>LOGGED. When a ship is on her beam ends, or in that state in which
she is unmanageable at sea. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#WATER-LOGGED">Water-logged</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a name="LOGGERHEAD" id="LOGGERHEAD"></a>LOGGERHEAD, <span class="sm1">or Logger-heat</span>. A round ball of iron attached to a

to pound cocoa before chocolate was supplied. Also, an upright rounded
piece of wood, near the stern of a whale-boat, for catching a turn of the
line to. Also, a name given to a well-known turtle, <i>Chelonia caouana</i>,
from its having a great head; it is sometimes called the <i>whooper</i> or
<i>whapper</i>. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#TURTLE">Turtle</a></span>.)</p>

<p>LOG-GLASS. The sand-glass used at heaving the log to obtain the rate of
sailing. It is a 28 seconds glass for slow sailing, and 14 seconds for fast
sailing.</p>

<p><a name="LOG-LINE" id="LOG-LINE"></a>LOG-LINE <span class="sm2">AND</span> LOG-SHIP. A small line about 100 fathoms long, fastened
to the log-ship by means of two legs, one of which passes through a
hole at the corner, and is knotted on the opposite side, while the other
leg is attached by a pin fixed into another hole so as to draw out when
<i>stop</i> is called, <i>i.e.</i> when the glass has run out. This line, from the distance
of 10, 12, or 15 fathoms of the log-ship, has certain knots or divisions,
which ought to be 47 feet 4 inches from each other, though it was the
common practice at sea not to have them above 42 feet. The estimate of
the ship's way or distance run is done by observing the length of the line
unwound whilst the glass is running; for so many knots as run out in
that time, so many miles the ship sails in an hour.&mdash;<i>To heave the log</i> is to
throw it into the water on the lee-side, well out of the wake, letting it
run until it gets beyond the eddies, then a person holding the glass turns
it up just as the first mark, or stray-line, goes out, from which the knots
begin to be reckoned. The log is, however, at best, a precarious way
of computing, and must be corrected by experience. The inventor of it
is not known, and no mention is made of it till the year 1607, in an East
India voyage, published by Purchas. The mode before, and even now in
some colliers, and in native craft in the East Indies, is to throw a <i>log</i> or
chip overboard at the foremost channel-plate, and to walk aft, keeping up
with it until it passes the stern, thus estimating (and closely too by practice)
the rate of motion. Other methods have been invented by various
people, but <i>Massey's Patent Log</i> gives the most accurate measurement.
The same principle is also applied to the deep-sea sounding-lead.</p>

<p>LOGWOOD. Dyewood, <i>H&aelig;matoxylon campechianum</i>. It occurs on both
sides of the American coasts near the Isthmus of Darien, and is a great
article of trade, varying from &pound;5 to &pound;10 per ton. Recent discoveries of
the products of coal have reduced the price.</p>

and a master to navigate, were furnished by the Cinque Ports, &amp;c., and
the fighting part of the men was composed of soldiers sent on board,
commanded by generals, &amp;c. Among the early voyagers there was a distinction
between <i>master</i> and <i>maister</i>, the latter being the office; as, "we
spoke the <i>Dragon</i>, whereof Master Ivie was maister," in Welsh's <i>Voyage
to Benin</i>, <span class="sm2">A.D.</span> 1590. In most applications, <i>master</i> denotes chief; as

with lieutenants on surveys, to examine and report on the provisions.
He is moreover charged with their stowage. For the performance of
these services he is allowed several assistants, who are termed second-masters,
master's assistants, &amp;c. This officer's station has been termed

<i>circa</i> 1556: it is a projection of the surface of the earth in the plane,
with all the meridians made parallel with each other, consequently the
degrees of longitude all equal, the degrees of latitude increasing in a corresponding
ratio towards the poles. This is the chart most commonly
used in navigation; and its use appears to have obtained quickly, for in

the zenith and the poles, and cutting the equator at right angles. When
the sun is on the meridian of any place, it is mid-day there, and at all
places situated under the same meridian.&mdash;<i>First meridian</i> is that from
which the longitude is reckoned. Magnetic meridian is not a great circle
but a wavy line uniting those poles. In common acceptation, a meridian
is any line supposed to be drawn from the north to the south pole; therefore
a place being under the same meridian as another place, is either
due north or south of it.&mdash;<i>Plane of the meridian</i> is the plane of this great
circle, and its intersection with the sensible horizon is called the <i>meridian
line</i>.&mdash;The <i>meridian transit</i> of a heavenly body is the act of passing over
the said plane, when it is either due north or south of the spectator.&mdash;<i>Ante

<p>MESS-DECK. The place where a ship's crew mess.</p>

<p>MESSENGER. A large cable-laid rope, used to unmoor or heave up the
anchor of a ship, by the aid of the capstan. This is done by binding a
part of the messenger to the cable by which the ship rides, in several
places, with pliant nippers, and by winding another part of it about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
capstan. The messenger has an eye-splice at each end, through which
several turns of a strong lashing are passed, forming an endless rope.
So that by putting on fresh nippers forward, and taking them off as they
are hove aft, the capstan may be kept constantly going, and the cable is
walked in without stopping. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#VIOL">Viol</a></span>.) A superior plan is now
adopted, in which the messenger, consisting of a pitch chain which has a
double and single link alternately, works in iron spurs fastened above
the lower rim of the capstan. This avoids the trouble of shifting or
fleeting the messenger while heaving in. Again, the cable itself is commonly
brought to the capstan.&mdash;<i>Light forward the messenger!</i> is the
order to pull the slack of it towards the hawse holes, on the slack or
opposite side, so as to be ready to fasten upon the cable which is being
hove in, as it comes off the manger-roller at the bows.</p>

<p>NEUTRALS. Those who do not by treaty owe anything to either party
in war; for if they do they are confederates. They are not to interfere
between contending powers; and the right of security justifies a belligerent
in enforcing the conditions. They are not allowed to trade from one port

trade. Indeed the simple conveyance of any article to the opponent of
the blockading squadron, at once settles the non-admission, or even
hovering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

taken off, a boy carrying it forward ready coiled for further use.&mdash;<i>Selvagee

<p>PORT. An old Anglo-Saxon word still in full use. It strictly means a
place of resort for vessels, adjacent to an emporium of commerce, where
cargoes are bought and sold, or laid up in warehouses, and where there
are docks for shipping. It is not quite a synonym of <i>harbour</i>, since the
latter does not imply traffic. Vessels hail from the port they have quitted,
but they are compelled to have the name of the vessel and of the port to
which they belong painted on the bow or stern.&mdash;<i>Port</i> is also in a legal
sense a refuge more or less protected by points and headlands, marked
out by limits, and may be resorted to as a place of safety, though there
are many ports but rarely entered. The left side of the ship is called
<i>port</i>, by admiralty order, in preference to <i>larboard</i>, as less mistakeable in
sound for starboard.&mdash;<i>To port the helm.</i> So to move the tiller as to carry
the rudder to the starboard side of the stern-post.&mdash;<i>Bar-port.</i> One which
can only be entered when the tide rises sufficiently to afford depth over
a bar; this in many cases only occurs at spring-tides.&mdash;<i>Close-port.</i> One

to load and unload their vessels, as the ports of Genoa and Leghorn.
Also, a term used for a total exemption of duties which any set of
merchants enjoy, for goods imported into a state, or those exported of
the growth of the country. Such was the privilege the English enjoyed
for several years after their discovery of the port of Archangel, and which
was taken from them on account of the regicide in 1648.</p>

<p><a name="PRIVATEERS" id="PRIVATEERS"></a>PRIVATEERS, or men-of-war equipped by individuals for cruising against
the enemy; their commission (<i>see</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#LETTERS_OF_MART">Letters of Marque</a></span>) is given by the
admiralty, and revocable by the same authority. They have no property
in any prize until it is legally condemned by a competent court. The
admiral on the station is entitled to a tenth of their booty. This infamous
species of warfare is unhappily not yet abolished among civilized
nations.</p>

the capture of private property on land; a right not even granted to men-of-war.

pirates, either by a man-of-war or privateer. Vessels are also looked
upon as <i>prize</i>, if they fight under any other standard than that of the
state from which they have their commission, if they have no charter-party,
and if loaded with effects belonging to the enemy, or with contraband
goods. In ships of war, the prizes are to be divided among the
officers, seamen, &amp;c., according to the act; but in privateers, according to
the agreement between the owners. By statute 13 Geo. II. c. 4, judges
and officers failing in their duty in respect to the condemnation of prizes,
forfeit &pound;500, with full costs of suit, one moiety to the crown, and the
other to the informer. Prize, according to jurists, is altogether a creature
of the crown; and no man can have any interest but what he takes as
the mere gift of the crown. Partial interest has been granted away at
different times, but the statute of Queen Anne (<span class="sm2">A.D.</span> 1708) is the first
which gave to the captors the whole of the benefit.</p>

<p>PRIZE ACT <span class="sm2">OF</span> 1793. Ordained that the officers and sailors on board
every ship and vessel of war shall have the sole property in all captures,
being first adjudged lawful prize, to be divided in such proportions and
manner as His Majesty should order by proclamation. In 1746 a man,
though involuntarily kept abroad above three years in the service of his
country, was deemed to have forfeited his share to Greenwich.</p>

angles. It was made of brass, or wood, with lines drawn from each side
intersecting one another, and an index divided by sines also, with 90&deg; on
the limb, and two sights on the edge, to take the altitude of the sun.
Sometimes, instead of sines, they were divided into equal parts. It was

common parlance applies to 45&deg; abaft the beam. Thus the log is hove
over the lee-quarter; quarter boats hang abaft the mizen-mast, &amp;c.
Again, the quarters apply to the divisional batteries, as forward, main,
middle, or lower-decks, forecastle, and quarter-deck, and yet these comprise

<p><a name="SEA" id="SEA"></a>SEA. Strictly speaking, <i>sea</i> is the next large division of water after <i>ocean</i>,
but in its special sense signifies only any large portion of the great mass
of waters almost surrounded by land, as the Black, the White, the Baltic,
the China, and the Mediterranean seas, and in a general sense in contradistinction
to land. By sailors the word is also variously applied. Thus
they say&mdash;"We shipped a heavy sea." "There is a great sea on in the
offing." "The sea sets to the southward," &amp;c. Hence a ship is said to head
the sea when her course is opposed to the direction of the waves.&mdash;<i>A long
sea</i> implies a uniform motion of long waves, the result of a steady
continuance of the wind from nearly the same quarter.&mdash;<i>A short sea</i> is a
confused motion of the waves when they run irregularly so as frequently
to break over a vessel, caused by sudden changes of wind. The law claims
for the crown wherever the sea flows to, and there the admiralty has
jurisdiction; accordingly, no act can be done, no bridge can span a river
so circumstanced without the sanction of the admiralty. It claims the
fore-shore unless specially granted by charter otherwise, and the court of
vice-admiralty has jurisdiction as to flotsam and jetsam on the fore-shore.
But all crimes are subject to the laws, and are tried by the ordinary courts
as within the body of a county, comprehended by the chord between two
headlands where the distance does not exceed three miles from the shore.
Beyond that limit is "the sea, where high court of admiralty has jurisdiction,
but where civil process cannot follow."</p>

<p>SEA-BOTTLE. The pod or vesicle of some species of <i>sea-wrack</i> or <i>Fucus
gigantea</i> of Cape Horn and the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p>SEA-BREEZE. A wind from the sea towards the land. In tropical
climates (and sometimes during summer in the temperate zone) as the
day advances the land becomes extremely heated by the sun, which
causes an ascending current of air, and a wind from the sea rushes in to
restore equilibrium. Above the sea-breeze is a counter current, which
was clearly shown in Madras, where an &aelig;ronaut waited until the sea-breeze
had set in to make his ascent, expecting to be blown inland, but
after rising to a certain height found himself going out to sea, and in his
haste to descend he disordered the machinery, and could not close the
valve which allowed the gas to escape, so fell into the sea about three
miles from the land, but clung to his balloon and was saved. Also, a
cool sea drink.</p>

<p>SHEERING. The act of deviating from the line of the course, so as to
form a crooked and irregular path through the water; this may be occasioned

given by the St. Lawrence at La Chine, there reported to rush in spring-time
at the rate of 40 miles an hour. Thus the shooting Old London
Bridge was the cause of many deaths, and gave occasion to the admirable
description in the <i>Loves of the Triangles</i> (anti-Jacobin), when all were
agreed:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<span class="i0">"'Shoot we the bridge,' the vent'rous boatmen cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Shoot we the bridge,' th' exulting fare reply."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><a name="SHOOT-FINGER" id="SHOOT-FINGER"></a>SHOOT-FINGER. This was a term in use with the Anglo-Saxons from
its necessity in archery, and is now called the trigger-finger from its equal

(<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#LEGS">Legs</a></span>.) Also, the general name for the littoral of any country against
which the waves impinge, while the word <i>coast</i> is applied to that part of

<p>SHORT, <span class="sm1">Short stay, Short apeek</span>. "Heave short," means to heave in
the cable till it is nearly up and down, and would hold the vessel securely
until she had set all common sail, and would not drag or upset the anchor.
If, however, the wind be free, and the making sail unimportant, <i>short</i>
would probably be <i>short apeek</i>, or up and down, the last move of weighing
awaiting perhaps signal or permission to part.</p>

<p>SHORT ALLOWANCE. When the provisions will not last the period
expected, they may be reduced in part, as two-thirds, half-allowance, &amp;c.,
and thus <i>short-allowance money</i> becomes due, which is the nominal value
of the provisions stopped, and paid in compensation.</p>

<p><a name="SHORT_BOARDS" id="SHORT_BOARDS"></a>SHORT BOARDS. Frequent tacking, where there is not room for long

the log when the ship is going fast.</p>

<p>SHOT. All sorts of missiles to be discharged from fire-arms, those for great
guns being mainly of iron; for small-arms, of lead. When used without
prefix, the term generally means the solid shot only, as fired for a heavy
blow, or for penetration. Also, a synonym of <i>scot</i>, a reckoning at an
inn, and has immemorially been thus understood. Ben Jonson's rules
are</p>

shot the guns.</i> In active service the guns were generally loaded, but not
shotted, as, from corrosion, it was found difficult to draw the shot; and
the working and concussion not unfrequently started it, and consequently,
if the gun was fired before re-driving it "home," it was in danger of
bursting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>SHOT-LOCKER. A compartment built up in the hold to contain the

<p><a name="SHRAPNEL_SHELL" id="SHRAPNEL_SHELL"></a>SHRAPNEL SHELL. Invented by General Shrapnel to produce, at a
long range, the effect of common case; whence they have been also called
<i>spherical case</i>. They have a thickness of only one-tenth of their diameter;
so that, on the action of the fuse, they are opened by a very small bursting
charge, and allow the bullets with which they are filled to proceed
with much the same direction and velocity that the shell had at the
moment of explosion. They require, however, extremely nice management.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span></p>

<p>SHROUD-ROPE. A finer quality of hawser-laid rope than is commonly
used for other purposes. It is also termed purchase-rope; but four-stranded
rope is frequently used for standing rigging. All the strands
are finer, of better hemp, and pass the gauge. Thus the patent shroud-laid
rope, made from clean Petersburgh hemp, was found to break at a strain

patent rope of 5 inches would require 175 cwt. Common rope, 25 threads
in each strand, broke with 5 cwt. per inch, and fell off at 130 threads to
4 cwt. per inch. Thus,</p>

shrouds</i> are now generally made of chain. They support the
bowsprit in the same way that other shrouds support the masts.&mdash;<i>Bumkin
or boomkin shrouds.</i> Strong chains fixed as stays to the bumkin
ends, to support the strain exerted by the fore-tacks upon them.&mdash;<i>Futtock
or foot-hook shrouds.</i> Portions of rigging (now sometimes chain)
communicating with the futtock-plates above the top, and the cat-harpings
below, and forming ladders, whereby the sailors climb over the top-brim.
<i>Top-gallant shrouds</i> extend to the cross-trees, where, passing through
holes in the ends, they continue over the futtock-staves of the top-mast
rigging, and descending almost to the top, are set up by laniards passing
through thimbles instead of dead-eyes.&mdash;<i>Topmast-shrouds</i> extend from
the top-mast head to the edges of the tops, and are set up to the futtock
dead-eyes.</p>

<p>SPILL, <span class="sm1">To</span>. Whether for safety or facility, it is advisable to shiver the
wind out of a sail before furling or reefing it. This is done either by
collecting the sail together, or by bracing it bye, so that the wind may

to order, "Sheevar the meezen taus'le, and let the fore-topmast staysail
lie dormant in the brails!"</p>

<p>SPILLING LINES. Ropes contrived to keep the sails from blowing
away when they are clued up, being rove before the sails like the buntlines

used in lead-lines, log-lines, and fishing-lines, where the short splice would
be liable to separation, as being frequently loosened by the water.&mdash;<i>The
long splice</i> occupies a great extent of rope, but by the three joinings being
fixed at a distance from each other, the increase of bulk is divided; hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
it resembles a continuous lay, and is adapted to run through the sheave-hole
of a block, &amp;c., for which use it is generally intended.&mdash;<i>The short

for smoothing rounds or hollows.</p>

<p>SPOLIATION <span class="sm1">of a Ship's Papers</span>. An act which, by the maritime law
of every court in Europe, not only excludes further proof, but does, <i>per
se</i>, infer condemnation. Our own code has so far relaxed that this circumstance
shall not be damnatory. The suppression of ships' papers,
however, is regarded in the admiralty courts with great suspicion.</p>

<p>SPRIT-SAIL TOP-SAIL. A sail extended above the sprit-sail by a yard,
which hung under the jib-boom.&mdash;<i>Top-gallant sprit-sail</i> was set upon
the flying jib-boom in the same manner that the sprit-sail was set upon
the inner jib-boom. The sprit-sail course, top-sail, and topgallant-sail

yards hang at right angles with the mast they are said to be "square
by the lifts;" when perpendicular to the ship's length, they are "square
by the braces;" but when they lie in a direction perpendicular to the
plane of the keel, they are "square by the lifts and braces." The yards
are said to be very square when they are of extraordinary length, and the
same epithet is applied to their sails with respect to their breadth. Also,

<p>STEERING [Anglo-Saxon <i>st&eacute;oran</i>]. The perfection of steering consists
in a vigilant attention to the motion of the ship's head, so as to check
every deviation from the line of her course in the first instant of its commencement,
and in applying as little of the power of the helm as possible,
for the action of the rudder checks a ship's speed.</p>

<p><a name="STEERING-SAIL" id="STEERING-SAIL"></a>STEERING-SAIL. An incorrect name for a studding-sail.</p>

<p>STEER LARGE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To go free, off the wind. Also, to steer loosely.</p>

outside of the stem is usually marked with a scale of feet and inches,
answering to a perpendicular from the keel, in order to ascertain the ship's

stem to stern</i>, from one end of the ship to the other.&mdash;<i>To stem</i>, to make
way against any obstacle. "She does not stem the tide," that is, she
cannot make head against it for want of wind.</p>

<span class="i0">You stand upon the rivage, and behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city on the inconstant billows dancing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so appears this fleet majestical,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>STERN-ALL. A term amongst whalers, meaning to pull the boat stern
foremost, to back off after having entered an iron (<i>harpoon</i>).</p>

<p>STERN-BOARD. This term is familiarly known to seamen as tacking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
by misadventure in stays; or purposely, as a seamanlike measure, to effect
the object. Thus a ship in a narrow channel is allowed to fly up head to
wind until her stem nearly touches a weather danger; the head-yards are
then quickly braced abox, and the helm shifted. Thus she makes stern-way
until all the sails are full, when she is again skilfully brought to the
wind before touching the danger under her lee. Generally speaking,
however, it refers to bad seamanship.</p>

<p>STERN-CHASERS. The guns which fire directly aft.</p>

<p>STERN-DAVITS. Pieces of iron or timber projecting from the stern,

thwart, furnished with seats for passengers.</p>

<p><a name="STERN-SON" id="STERN-SON"></a>STERN-SON. A knee-piece of oak-timber, worked on the after dead-wood;

<p>STEWARD. There are several persons under this appellation in most
ships, according to their size, appointed to the charge of the sea-stores of
the various grades. The paymaster's steward has most to do, having to
serve the crew, and therefore has assistants, distinguished by the sobriquet
of Jack-o'-the-dust, &amp;c. In large passenger ships which do not carry a
purser, part of his duties devolves upon the captain's steward. In smaller
merchant ships the special duties of the steward are not heavy, so that he
assists in the working of the ship, and in tacking; his station is, <i>ex officio</i>,
the main-sheet.</p>

ship stands up to her canvas, and carries enough sail without heeling over
too much.</p>

<p>STIFF BOTTOM. A clayey bottom.</p>

<p>STIFF BREEZE. One in which a ship may carry a press of sail, when a
little more would endanger the spars.</p>

<p>STIFFENING ORDER. A custom-house warrant for making a provision

under the lee of headlands, or where there is neither tide nor current.</p>

<p>STING-RAY. A fish, <i>Trygon pastinaca</i>, which wounds with a serrate
bone, lying in a sheath on the upper side of its tail; the wound is painful,

rope having a large knot at one end, and hooked or lashed to a ring-bolt
in the deck by the other; it is attached to the cable by a laniard, which
is passed securely round both, by several turns passed behind the knot, or
round the neck of the stopper, by which means the cable is restrained
from running out of the ship when she rides, and is an additional
security to the bitted cable.&mdash;<i>Dog-stopper.</i> A strong rope clenched round
the main-mast, and used on particular occasions to relieve and assist the

manner as those of the cables, to the wounded parts of the shroud, &amp;c.,
which are thereby strengthened, so as to be fit for service. Other
rigging-stoppers have dead-eyes and tails, so that by securing one dead-eye
above and the other below the injury, they can be set up by their
laniard, and brought to an even strain with the other shrouds. Stoppers

comes under the usual exception in charter-parties and bills of lading, of
"all and every dangers of the seas, rivers, and navigation of whatsoever
nature or kind;" and in all policies of insurance it falls under the general
words of "all other perils, losses, or misfortunes," against the risk of
which the insurance is made.</p>

prevent her rolling to windward in the trough of a sea. Close-hauled
under all sail, a vessel gains head-way within six points of the wind; but
in <i>trying</i> she may come up to five and fall off to seven: so that a vessel
does not hold her own. If the vessel be in proper trim, or properly
stowed, she will naturally keep to the wind; but custom, and deficiency of
seamanlike ability, have induced the lazy habit of lashing the helm a-lee.</p>

meridian line on a horizontal plane; or an arc of the horizon, comprehended
between the true and the magnetic meridian. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#ANNUAL_VARIATION">Annual

wear, in contradistinction from tacking. In tacking it is a necessary
condition that the ship be brought up to the wind as close-hauled, and
put round against the wind on the opposite tack. But in veering or
wearing, especially when strong gales render it dangerous, unseamanlike,
or impossible, the head of the vessel is put away from the wind, and
turned round 20 points of the compass instead of 12, and, without strain
or danger, is brought to the wind on the opposite tack. Many deep-thinking
seamen, and Lords St. Vincent, Exmouth, and Sir E. Owen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
issued orders to wear instead of tacking, when not inconvenient, deeming

<p>VEER AND HAUL, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To gently tauten and then slacken a rope
three times before giving a heavy pull, the object being to concentrate
the force of several men. The wind is said to veer and haul when it
alters its direction; thus it is said, to veer aft, and haul forward.</p>

<p>VEER AWAY THE CABLE, <span class="sm1">To</span>. To slack and let it run out.</p>

<p>VEERING CABLE, <span class="sm1">The</span>. That cable which is veered out in unmooring,

form to a ship's body by which she will pass through the water in the
quickest space of time.</p>

<p>VELOCITY OF TIDE <span class="sm2">OR</span> CURRENT, depends on several circumstances.
First, the tide varies with the state of the moon, running strongest at the
springs, and the force of the ebb is much increased by rains, land freshes,
&amp;c. The currents also vary, especially when wind and tide combine to
accelerate their action.</p>

as that it will fall vertically, or nearly so, to its destination. It includes
all elevations above 30&deg;, though the most usual is 45&deg;. It is very effective
with shells; but with small balls, as proposed by Carnot and others, who
have ill reckoned the retardation by the atmosphere, it is insignificant.</p>

centre of vertical force that the water exerts to support the immersed
vessel. Also, the dip of the magnetic needle, measured by vibrations of

officers are divided into three watches, in order to lighten their duty; but
it is to be borne in mind that the watch may sleep when their services
are not demanded, whereas it is a crime, liable to death, for an officer to
sleep on his watch. In a ship of war the watch is generally commanded

buoyant cargo that she does not sink. In this dangerous and unmanageable
situation there is no resource for the crew except to free her by the
pumps, or to abandon her by taking to the boats; for the centre of gravity
being no longer fixed, the ship entirely loses her stability, and is almost
totally deprived of the use of her sails, which may only operate to accelerate
her destruction by over-setting her, or pressing her head under
water. Timber-laden vessels, water-logged, frequently float for a very long
period.</p>

boiler.</p>

<p><a name="WATER-SPOUT" id="WATER-SPOUT"></a>WATER-SPOUT. A large mass of water collected in a vertical column,
and moving rapidly along the surface of the sea. As contact with one
has been supposed dangerous, it has been suggested to fire cannon at them,
to break the continuity by a&euml;rial concussion. In this phenomenon, heat
and electricity seem to take an active part, but their cause is not fully
explained, and any facts respecting them by observers favourably placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>

for <i>wake</i>. Thus when she begins her motion she is said to be <i>under way</i>;
and when that motion increases, to have <i>fresh-way</i> through the water.
Hence, also, she is said to have <i>head-way</i> or <i>stern-way</i>, to <i>gather way</i> or

a word also applied to everything lying to windward of a particular situation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
hence a ship is said to have the weather-gage of another when further
to windward. Thus also, when a ship under sail presents either of her
sides to the wind, it is then called the <i>weather-side</i>, and all the rigging
situated thereon is distinguished by the same epithet. It is the opposite

<p>WHALE. A general term for various marine animals of the order <i>Cetacea</i>,
including the most colossal of all animated beings. From their general
form and mode of life they are frequently confounded with fish, from
which, however, they differ essentially in their organization, as they are
warm-blooded, ascend to the surface to breathe air, produce their young
alive, and suckle them, as do the land mammalia. The cetacea are divided
into two sections:&mdash;1. Those having horny plates, called baleen, or "whalebone,"
growing from the palate instead of teeth, and including the <a href="#RIGHT_WHALE">right
whales</a> and <a href="#RORQUAL">rorquals</a>, or <a href="#FINNER">finners</a> and <a href="#HUMP-BACKED_WHALE">hump-backs</a> (see these terms). 2. Those
having true teeth and no whalebone. To this group belong the sperm-whale,
and the various forms of bottle-noses, black-fish, grampuses, narwhals,
dolphins, porpoises, &amp;c. To the larger species of many of these
the term "whale" is often applied.</p>

<p>WHALE-FISHERIES. The places at which the capture of whales, or
"whale-fishery," is carried on. The principal are the coasts of Greenland
and Davis Straits, for the northern right whale; Bermuda, for hump-backs;
the Cape of Good Hope and the Australian seas, for the southern
right whale; the North Pacific, for the Japanese right whale; and various
places in the intertropical and southern seas, for the sperm-whale. But
the constant persecution to which these animals are subjected causes a
frequent change in their habitats. They have been nearly exterminated,
or rendered so scarce as not to be worth following, in many districts
where they formerly most abounded, and in order to make the trade
remunerative, new grounds have to be continually sought. Maury's
"whale charts" give much valuable information on this subject.</p>

and the size of vessels using it.&mdash;<i>Wharf</i>, in hydrography, is a scar, a rocky
or gravelly concretion, or frequently a sand-bank, as Mad Wharf in Lancashire,
where the tides throw up dangerous ripples and overfalls.</p>

<p>WHARFAGE DUES. The dues for landing or shipping goods at a
wharf; customs charges in particular. Thus for goods not liable to duty,
and forcibly taken for examination, wharfage charges are demanded even
from a ship of war!</p>

of the capstan. The whelps reach downwards from the lower part of the
drumhead to the deck. The pieces of wood bolted on the main-piece of
a windlass, or on a winch, for firm holding, and to prevent chafing, are
also called whelps.</p>

<p>WHERRY. A name descended from the Roman <i>horia</i>, the <i>oare</i> of our
early writers. It is now given to a sharp, light, and shallow boat used
in rivers and harbours for passengers. The wherries allowed to ply about

heads. Amidships it is supported by chocks, where it is also furnished
with a course of windlass-pawls, four taking at separate angles on a main

<p><a name="WINDS" id="WINDS"></a>WINDS. <i>Local</i> or <i>peculiar</i>.&mdash;<i>Trade-winds</i> occur within and beyond the
tropical parallels. They are pretty regular in the North Atlantic, as far
as 5&deg; N., where calms may be expected, or the south-east trade may reach
across, depending on the season; but when near land they yield to the
<i>land and sea breezes</i>. Thus at 10&deg; N. the land-breeze will be at E. from
11 <span class="sm2">P.M.</span> until 6 <span class="sm2">A.M.</span>, then calm intervenes up to 10 <span class="sm2">A.M.</span>, when the sea-breeze
sets in, probably W., and blows home fresh. Yet at 20 miles off
shore the trade-wind may blow pretty strong from N.E. or E.N.E.&mdash;The
<i>harmattan</i> is a sudden dry wind blowing off the coast of Africa, so
charged with almost impalpable dust that the sun is obscured. It sucks
up all moisture, cracks furniture and earthenware, and prostrates animal
nature. The rigging of vessels becomes a dirty brown, and the dust adhering
to the blacking cannot be removed.&mdash;The <i>tornado</i> lasts for a short
time, but is of great force during its continuance.&mdash;The <i>northers</i> in the
Gulf of Mexico, or off the Heads of Virginia, are not only very heavy
gales, but are attended with severe cold. On a December day, off Galveston,
the temperature in a calm was at sunset 86&deg;. The norther came
on about midnight, and at 8 <span class="sm2">A.M.</span> the temperature had fallen to 12&deg;, and
icicles were hanging from the eaves of the houses. The <i>Tiempo di Vendavales</i>,
or southers of Western America, is an opposite, blowing heavily
home to the coast. The <i>taifung</i> of China, or typhoon of the Indian seas,
is indeed precisely similar to the hurricane of the West Indies.</p>

<p>WIND-SAIL. A funnel of canvas employed to ventilate a ship by conveying
a stream of fresh air down to the lower decks. It is suspended

the large casks would cause too great a rising in that part of the tier.</p>

<p><a name="WINGS" id="WINGS"></a>WINGS. Those parts of the hold and orlop-deck which are nearest to the
sides. This term is particularly used in the stowage of the several
materials contained in the hold, and between the cable-tiers and the
ship's sides. In ships of war they are usually kept clear, that the carpenter
and his crew may have access round the ship to stop shot-holes in time of
action. Also, the skirts or extremities of a fleet, when ranged in a line
abreast, or when forming two sides of a triangle. It is usual to extend
the wings of a fleet in the daytime, in order to discover any enemy that

to form close order before night. In military parlance, the right and
left divisions of a force, whether these leave a centre division between

<p>YACHT. A vessel of state or pleasure: the former is usually employed to
convey great personages. One of the designs of a yacht being accommodation,
they are usually fitted up with great comfort; their propulsion is by
sails or steam. Small yachts, rigged as sloops, were formerly used by
the commissioners of the navy; they were originally royal yachts, and one
at Chatham was renowned as the yacht of Queen Elizabeth, the same
plate being in use in her up to a very late date. Private pleasure-boats,
when sufficiently large for a sea voyage, are also termed yachts. (<i>See</i>
<span class="sm1"><a href="#ROYAL_YACHT">Royal Yacht</a></span>.)</p>

<p><a name="YACHT_CLUB" id="YACHT_CLUB"></a>YACHT CLUB, ROYAL. An institution embodied by a number of noblemen

<p><a name="YARD" id="YARD"></a>YARD [Anglo-Saxon <i>gyrde</i>]. A long cylindrical timber suspended upon
the mast of a vessel to spread a sail. They are termed square, lateen, or
lug: the first are suspended across the masts at right angles, and the two
latter obliquely. The square yards taper from the middle, which is called
the slings, towards the extremities, which are termed the yard-arms; and
the distance between is divided by the artificers into quarters, called the
first, second, third quarters, and yard-arms. The middle quarters are
formed into eight sides, and each of the end parts is figured like the
frustum of a cone: on the alternate sides of the octagon, in large spars,
oak battens are brought on and hooped, so as to strengthen, and yet not
greatly increase, the weight.&mdash;<i>To brace the yards.</i> To traverse them
about the masts, so as to form greater or lesser angles with the ship's
length. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#BRACE">Brace</a></span>.)&mdash;<i>To square the yards.</i> (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#SQUARE">Square</a></span>.)</p>

<p>YARD-ARM. That part of a yard outside the quarter, which is on either

are secured. The reef-cleats on the topsail-yards are beyond the lifts
and braces.</p>

a yard-arm if shot away. It is one-third the length of the main-yard.</p>

<p><a name="YARD-ROPE" id="YARD-ROPE"></a>YARD-ROPE. Is only used for temporary purposes; the most usual
application of the term is that by which a yard is hoisted for crossing, or
sent down. Also, rove for execution. The yard-rope of the lighter yards
is the halliards, which, when the yard is crossed, is made into tie and
halliards by a peculiar mode of toggling on the halliard purchase, as in
the order, "Toggle the halliards!"</p>

ship, whereby, with the assistance of the stay-tackles, the boats and other
weights are hoisted in and out. Yard-tackles are sometimes hooked to a
pendant, which is secured to the top-mast head, and hauled out to the
yard-arm by means of a small tackle, until the yard-tackle plumbs the
spot where it is wished to work.</p>

<p>YARN. One of the threads of which ropes are composed. A number of
these are twisted together to form a strand, in proportion to the size of
the proposed rope. Three strands are then twisted into one another,
which completes the process of ordinary rope-making; but cables, hawsers,
and other ground tackling, are composed of three strands, each of which
is formed of three lesser ones. (<i>See</i> <span class="sm1"><a href="#CABLE">Cable</a>, <a href="#HAWSER">Hawser</a></span>, &amp;c.)&mdash;<i>A tough yarn.</i>
